<p>You can use the app for The paid service of Shazam goes by the name of Shazam Encore and it costs $2.99.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shazam"><a href="#2-Shazam" class="headerlink" title="2.  Shazam"></a>2.  Shazam</h3><p>Shazam is the most popular music recognition app available out there, and its features will tell you why. To begin with, it does the basic task of any music recognition service with near 100% accuracy.</p>
<p>It draws up all available information of a song you want identifying, from its huge database in a short time. There is also a lyrics feature that displays lyrics in sync with the song being played so you can sing along with it.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Choose-a-Music-Recognition-App"><a href="#How-to-Choose-a-Music-Recognition-App" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose a Music Recognition App?"></a>How to Choose a Music Recognition App?</h2><p>Version 14.2 has made it easy to recognize songs on your iDevices. But those who do not have it need a third-party app to do that job. You need to look for a good iPhone song recognition app, one that does the job to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of such apps available on the Apple App Store, and you need to sift through them to get the best one. Following are the features you should consider while choosing the most appropriate app:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, you come across unknown songs in noisy surroundings. It can be at a party or the supermarket. Your song recording can be interrupted by some loud noise like joyous shouts or announcements in both scenarios. Hence, it is vital that the music recognition app launches, listens and identifies in a few seconds before any interruption takes place.</p>
<p>Ideally, the app should recognize the song within a span of 5 to 10 seconds of launching.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tenacity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As already been said, you are more likely to encounter an unknown song or tune you like in a noisy environment. Keeping that in mind, the song identifier app must be able to distinguish between the song you want to identify and the surrounding noise accompanying it.</p>
<p>The Trial and error method is the best way to determine which app does the best job in this case. Test the apps in a noisy environment before you decide which you will ultimately use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying a song title, the artists, the album it belongs to with nearly 100% accuracy is a must for any music recognition app. Besides that basic info, it must give accurate allied information like music videos, covers and trivia regarding the singer and the song.</p>
<p>Don’t bother yourself with an app that doesn’t recognize at least 8 of 10 songs it hears.</p>
<h2 id="FAQs-About-Recognizing-Songs-on-iPhone"><a href="#FAQs-About-Recognizing-Songs-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Recognizing Songs on iPhone"></a>FAQs About Recognizing Songs on iPhone</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Should I install Shazam app on iPhone to recognize songs?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It depends on what version of iOS you are running. If the version is 14.2 and above, you don’t need to install Shazam separately as it comes integrated with your iPhone software. The in-built music recognition feature of the iPhone uses the Shazam database, and it recognizes songs and tunes the way the Shazam app does.</p>
<p>If you are running an older version, you need to install Shazam separately if you want to use it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What’s the difference between the Shazam app and the in-built Shazam music recognition feature?</strong></li>

<p>Your iPhone will only listen for 10 to 15 seconds after you tap the button. If it can’t identify a song in that period of time, you’ll see a notification saying a song wasn’t detected.</p>

<li><strong>Should I install Shazam app on iPhone to recognize songs?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It depends on what version of iOS you are running. If the version is 14.2 and above, you don’t need to install Shazam separately as it comes integrated with your iPhone software. The in-built music recognition feature of the iPhone uses the Shazam database, and it recognizes songs and tunes the way the Shazam app does.</p>
<p>If you are running an older version, you need to install Shazam separately if you want to use it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What’s the difference between the Shazam app and the in-built Shazam music recognition feature?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>iOS users who haven’t upgraded to the iOS 14.2 update will not be able to access the features</p>
<p>When the process is complete, you’ll see a “Music Recognition” notification banner showing you what song is playing. This notification appears along with all your other apps’ notifications in your notification center.</p>
<p>Your iPhone will only listen for 10 to 15 seconds after you tap the button. If it can’t identify a song in that period of time, you’ll see a notification saying a song wasn’t detected.</p>
