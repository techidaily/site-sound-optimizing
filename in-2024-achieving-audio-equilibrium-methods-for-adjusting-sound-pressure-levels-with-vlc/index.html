            <h2 id="Achieving-Audio-Equilibrium-Methods-for-Adjusting-Sound-Pressure-Levels-with-VLC"><a href="#Achieving-Audio-Equilibrium-Methods-for-Adjusting-Sound-Pressure-Levels-with-VLC" class="headerlink" title="Achieving Audio Equilibrium: Methods for Adjusting Sound Pressure Levels with VLC"></a>Achieving Audio Equilibrium: Methods for Adjusting Sound Pressure Levels with VLC</h2><h2 id="How-To-Normalize-Volume-in-VLC"><a href="#How-To-Normalize-Volume-in-VLC" class="headerlink" title="How To Normalize Volume in VLC"></a>How To Normalize Volume in VLC</h2><p>How to normalize volume, why should we do it, and what is it after all? – these are the questions when it comes to editing our audio files, as well as the video clips we tend to change the sound of. So, first of all, the volume normalization is pretty much explained as follows: The process when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, which is “the norm” for the project. If it is a little bit difficult to understand, we have to highlight that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.</p>
<p>But, why bother at all and why not leave it the way it is? Well, the answer to this is almost the same as on why editing exists in general, right? Things are not perfect! This is the fact that prompts us to make our video clips and audio better, improve it at least on the level which can get us the right amount of viewers and listeners. Everyone have had some pain listening to several podcasts, when the volume was too high or too low, or there were so much background noise that the whole recording was hurting the ears of a person! People will not convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners if their user experience is not favored. So, it is in our best interest to serve their best interest, with a little bit of editing.</p>
<p>When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.</p>
<p>In the first case, you might have somewhat quite voice recording, and would like to make it better without changing its dynamic range, while making it as loud as possible. And when it comes to matching volumes, it is logical that you need to manipulate your editing this way in case you have a group of audio files, each or some of them are at different volumes, so, understandably, if not necessarily, you would like to make them come closer to the same volume.</p>
<p>So, until we give you the step-by step guide on how to normalize your volume in VLC player, we also need to inform you about audio normalization types. Here, generally, we come across three of them: a so-called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; another is called loudness normalization and it adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness. Last but not least, RMS (Root-Mean-Square), changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p>
<p>Using any of this, making it better to listen to your voice, without people being annoyed and their ears becoming exhausting with what you have to offer, you will be making it enjoyable for them and easy to come back to your content, as they will not be obliged to change the volume on their own audio players. Instead, their experience with you will be calm and effortless, which you are aiming to achieve.</p>
<p>So, not, what about VLC? – this is a very popular media player, favorite for a lot of people all around the world, so you should already be quite familiar with what it is, at least by having streamed videos and movies there. Speaking more of what it represents, it is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It is worth noting that it can also play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC and additionally, the program can stream from popular websites such as Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and so on.</p>
<p>As if it was not enough, you can do simple video and audio editing in VLC Media Player, which a lot of people are unaware of! For example, you can easily trim and cut videos. So, as it happens, we can also normalize volume in VLC Media Player. It is a very handy feature and it works on Windows as well as on Mac. Sooo… How to do that? Because, actually, it is so simple that you might be surprised you didn’t know about this earlier. To learn how to normalize volume in VLC, follow this simple guideline:</p>
<p>First, of course, as every time working with any software, you need to have VLC Media Player installed on your device. Once you have it installed, open VLC. Go to the Tools and Preferences and there, you will need to check the single box which is next to Normalize volume in Effects. Now, set the level to the one that works best for you. Then, when you are happy with the result, you can Save.</p>
<p>This is not something perfect, because it’s so simple to do and actually what it does is just help adjust the general volume, so it leaves the specifics alone.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-1.jpg"
                      alt="help adjust general volume"
                ></p>
<p>But, it might be the case that you are not so satisfied with the simple editing and want a little more to get from the editing process on VLC. So, you can do more with the Audio Effects menu there. And the steps are as follows:</p>
<p>First, on your VLC player, find Tools and then, in the menu, go to Preferences. The window will open, and there you need to select All in Show settings – actually it is a little bit hard to find because this is in the bottom left corner of the window. From there, you will need to navigate to Audio, and then, a little below, click on Filters and highlight it. The checkbox next to the Dynamic range compressor will probably be unchecked – so, check in it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-2.jpg"
                      alt="find tools and go to preferences"
                ></p>
<p>Next, see where Compressor is in the left panel? Select it. And now, you are free to make the changes to the levels as you see fit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-3.jpg"
                      alt="see compressor"
                ></p>
<p>Here, if you are a little bit overwhelmed with the wide range of options to work on, you can just concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.</p>
<p>Don’t underestimate Attack time and release time, either. They graduate the changes to ramp them up at first, then down again, rather than initiating them immediately. So, if you set them to your liking as well, this will ensure that you have a more fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, sometimes scary volume changes.</p>
<p>Therefore, you are now equipped with the most information you will need to normalize volume in VLC Player – so free to give it a go, play around with the different settings and carry out the best result imaginable for you!</p>

Something worth discussing is a software called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which carries out the same task wonderfully. Although, unlike VLC Media Player, it is a real <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but don’t panic if you have never laid your hand on editing – it is one of the easiest to use ini the word, operating also both on Mac and Windows, and its interface is utterly understandable for beginners right away. And, actually, it is a qhile that Wondershare Filmora X introduced the feature to normalize the audio for the first time. What to say more - you might want to stop now and download the latest version of Filmora because now we are about to learn how to normalize audio from the video there – so, tune in!</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p>

<p>When it is done installing, open the software. Now, click and drag the video of which the audio you want to normalize. Now you can select the clip you have chosen – if there are multiple, select all of them, then right-click and choose Detach Audio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Now if you have this kind of graphic before your eyes, you can be pretty sure without even listening, that the noises are really, really different from each other, which highlights once again how useful audio normalization can be:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="noise are different from each other"
                ></p>
<p>Select these files, right-click and choose Adjust Audio. New panel will be opened on left top and there, you will see Audio Normalization – check the box there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-6.jpg"
                      alt="select files"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-7.jpg"
                      alt="choose adjust audio"
                ></p>
<p>After you have clicked on it, wait until the normalization completes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-8.jpg"
                      alt="complete normalization"
                ></p>
<p>Soon, all audio will be normalized, and you will already be able to see on the graphics that the volumes are almost on the same level and when you listen to it, you will make sure that there is no longer apparent difference between how they sound. And from there on, you can save the file you just normalized!</p>
<p>So, in this article, we learned a lot about normalizing volumes, why and how it is done, and, more specifically, how to get this task completed in VLC Media Player as well as in Wondershare Filmora X. you can proceed to putting this new information into a good use and come back to learn more about video and audio editing here!</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now if you have this kind of graphic before your eyes, you can be pretty sure without even listening, that the noises are really, really different from each other, which highlights once again how useful audio normalization can be:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-5.jpg"
                      alt="noise are different from each other"
                ></p>
<p>Select these files, right-click and choose Adjust Audio. New panel will be opened on left top and there, you will see Audio Normalization – check the box there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-6.jpg"
                      alt="select files"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-7.jpg"
                      alt="choose adjust audio"
                ></p>
<p>After you have clicked on it, wait until the normalization completes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-8.jpg"
                      alt="complete normalization"
                ></p>
<p>Soon, all audio will be normalized, and you will already be able to see on the graphics that the volumes are almost on the same level and when you listen to it, you will make sure that there is no longer apparent difference between how they sound. And from there on, you can save the file you just normalized!</p>
<p>So, in this article, we learned a lot about normalizing volumes, why and how it is done, and, more specifically, how to get this task completed in VLC Media Player as well as in Wondershare Filmora X. you can proceed to putting this new information into a good use and come back to learn more about video and audio editing here!</p>

<h2 id="What-is-a-Video-Podcast"><a href="#What-is-a-Video-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="What is a Video Podcast?"></a>What is a Video Podcast?</h2><p>In simple words, a video podcast is generally a video format of audio podcasts. Overall, it is video content than mere audio content. Thus, they can’t listen to MP3 players. You must have a high-end digital media player, iTunes, and other video hosting platforms to listen to these kinds of podcasts. You can call it by a different name like vodcasting or videocasting as well. It is a version of podcasting despite other formats or versions of podcasts, including interview format, startup format, etc.</p>
<h2 id="Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference"><a href="#Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference" class="headerlink" title="Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?"></a>Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>There is a visual difference between a vlog and a video podcast. Even though you can share both the content formats on a robust platform like YouTube, a video podcast is still different from a vlog in many terms.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Content</strong></p>
<p>The very first Difference is the type of content posted on both platforms. Vlogging is a kind of informal content presentation, whereas a vodcast is presented most formally in different versions.</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong></p>
<p>The vloggers generally show their lifestyles in various forms while also spreading social messages in some of their videos. A vlog may or may not be informative to the audience. On the other hand, a video podcaster is obliged to present its audience with informative content. Whether in the version of a startup, interview, conversational, or a repurposed content, almost every video podcast is highly instructive.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Versions</strong></p>
<p>You can have a video podcast in different versions or formats, including Interviews, Startup Conversations, Laptop Lifestyles, First Launch Conversations, Solo&#x2F; Monologue, Co-Hosting, or Hosting Regular Show. On the other hand, vlogging comes in various versions or types, namely Lifestyle, Makeup, Gaming, Fitness, Unboxing, and Reviews. It is generally informally represented to showcase reality to the audience.</p>
<h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting"></a>Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting</h2><p>There are many such merits and demerits of video podcasts if you decide to do it on a large scale. As mentioned earlier, it won’t be that easy if you are not consistent and committed. It will also help if you consider the following advantages and disadvantages of video podcasting as follows.</p>
<p>Pros of Video Podcasts</p>
<p><strong>Easy Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>An easy reach and wide accessibility is the first significant advantage of hosting a podcast. Every second person nowadays is fond of listening to podcasts, whether in audio or video formats. A podcast is a whole pack of informational content that doesn’t need further FAQs and similar issues to mention separately. On the other hand, accessibility is also comprehensive as everyone is utilizing the platform like YouTube.</p>
<p>A video podcast is the better alternative if you don’t have the required setup and budget to promote your business operations.</p>
<p><strong>Convenient</strong></p>
<p>Podcasts or Video Podcasts are more convenient options, especially on YouTube. Despite getting high value, a video podcast can listen everywhere when you have YouTube. Due to convenience, they are pretty similar to listening to an audio podcast, which is also free of cost except for your internet charges. A YouTube-hosted video podcast doesn’t need a paid subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Encourages productivity</strong></p>
<p>The very idea of presenting a podcast is to offer authentic information formally. It doesn’t matter what format you choose to host the best video podcast; it contains reliable information and the elements to encourage productivity in viewers’ minds.</p>
<p>Cons of Video Podcasts</p>
<p><strong>The challenging process of finding a relevant audience</strong></p>
<p>It may be super tough to find the relevant audience in the beginning. You may have to advertise on YouTube to see the audience. Else, a strategic marketing policy for your channel to ensure consistency and retention of followers or audience.</p>
<p><strong>Time Consuming</strong></p>
<p>Making a video podcast is generally a time-consuming procedure, specifically when you are new to the technical aspects. Well, a person who is passionate about podcasting can even hire a video editor to fulfill the editing and similar tasks. But that won’t be beneficial in the long run. It’s essential to learn video podcasting and further video editing to cut costs on a long-term basis.</p>
<p><strong>Distracting</strong></p>
<p>You should not create a podcast if it is distracting the audience within the first five minutes. That’s the primary concern as creating visually appealing video podcasts is more than challenging, especially for a beginner. Due to the podcasting hype, many creators develop video podcasts that are not even useful and highly distracting for the audience.</p>

<p>The journalists, influencers, celebrities, and a friend of yours, everyone has a podcast! Even though the podcast is there for a decade, it is becoming highly famous now. It all started in 2005 when Apple announced broadcasting podcasts. There were radios before podcasting, and still, they are there!</p>

<p>We are now talking about <strong>video podcasts</strong> in the best possible manner. Is it worth creating video when it is primarily for audio format? Yes, it is not that easy as it seems to be! There are many versions to create video podcasts. Turning on a video while making a podcast is quite smart as now you have the required video content to post on YouTube. But that would be painful if you can’t hold the audience’s attention for more than five minutes. Visually compelling contents seem to be very important, especially when hosting your podcast on a central social platform such as YouTube.</p>
<p>Stay tuned as we are going to unleash the required elements to make the best video podcasts!</p>

<h2 id="What-is-a-Video-Podcast-3"><a href="#What-is-a-Video-Podcast-3" class="headerlink" title="What is a Video Podcast?"></a>What is a Video Podcast?</h2><p>In simple words, a video podcast is generally a video format of audio podcasts. Overall, it is video content than mere audio content. Thus, they can’t listen to MP3 players. You must have a high-end digital media player, iTunes, and other video hosting platforms to listen to these kinds of podcasts. You can call it by a different name like vodcasting or videocasting as well. It is a version of podcasting despite other formats or versions of podcasts, including interview format, startup format, etc.</p>
<h2 id="Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference-3"><a href="#Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?"></a>Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>There is a visual difference between a vlog and a video podcast. Even though you can share both the content formats on a robust platform like YouTube, a video podcast is still different from a vlog in many terms.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Content</strong></p>
<p>The very first Difference is the type of content posted on both platforms. Vlogging is a kind of informal content presentation, whereas a vodcast is presented most formally in different versions.</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong></p>
<p>The vloggers generally show their lifestyles in various forms while also spreading social messages in some of their videos. A vlog may or may not be informative to the audience. On the other hand, a video podcaster is obliged to present its audience with informative content. Whether in the version of a startup, interview, conversational, or a repurposed content, almost every video podcast is highly instructive.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Versions</strong></p>
<p>You can have a video podcast in different versions or formats, including Interviews, Startup Conversations, Laptop Lifestyles, First Launch Conversations, Solo&#x2F; Monologue, Co-Hosting, or Hosting Regular Show. On the other hand, vlogging comes in various versions or types, namely Lifestyle, Makeup, Gaming, Fitness, Unboxing, and Reviews. It is generally informally represented to showcase reality to the audience.</p>
<h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting-3"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting"></a>Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting</h2><p>There are many such merits and demerits of video podcasts if you decide to do it on a large scale. As mentioned earlier, it won’t be that easy if you are not consistent and committed. It will also help if you consider the following advantages and disadvantages of video podcasting as follows.</p>
<p>Pros of Video Podcasts</p>
<p><strong>Easy Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>An easy reach and wide accessibility is the first significant advantage of hosting a podcast. Every second person nowadays is fond of listening to podcasts, whether in audio or video formats. A podcast is a whole pack of informational content that doesn’t need further FAQs and similar issues to mention separately. On the other hand, accessibility is also comprehensive as everyone is utilizing the platform like YouTube.</p>
<p>A video podcast is the better alternative if you don’t have the required setup and budget to promote your business operations.</p>
<p><strong>Convenient</strong></p>
<p>Podcasts or Video Podcasts are more convenient options, especially on YouTube. Despite getting high value, a video podcast can listen everywhere when you have YouTube. Due to convenience, they are pretty similar to listening to an audio podcast, which is also free of cost except for your internet charges. A YouTube-hosted video podcast doesn’t need a paid subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Encourages productivity</strong></p>
<p>The very idea of presenting a podcast is to offer authentic information formally. It doesn’t matter what format you choose to host the best video podcast; it contains reliable information and the elements to encourage productivity in viewers’ minds.</p>
<p>Cons of Video Podcasts</p>
<p><strong>The challenging process of finding a relevant audience</strong></p>
<p>It may be super tough to find the relevant audience in the beginning. You may have to advertise on YouTube to see the audience. Else, a strategic marketing policy for your channel to ensure consistency and retention of followers or audience.</p>
<p><strong>Time Consuming</strong></p>
<p>Making a video podcast is generally a time-consuming procedure, specifically when you are new to the technical aspects. Well, a person who is passionate about podcasting can even hire a video editor to fulfill the editing and similar tasks. But that won’t be beneficial in the long run. It’s essential to learn video podcasting and further video editing to cut costs on a long-term basis.</p>
<p><strong>Distracting</strong></p>
<p>You should not create a podcast if it is distracting the audience within the first five minutes. That’s the primary concern as creating visually appealing video podcasts is more than challenging, especially for a beginner. Due to the podcasting hype, many creators develop video podcasts that are not even useful and highly distracting for the audience.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-create-a-Video-Podcast-3"><a href="#How-to-create-a-Video-Podcast-3" class="headerlink" title="How to create a Video Podcast?"></a>How to create a Video Podcast?</h2><p>Let’s review the step-by-step guide to create a video podcast, as mentioned below!</p>
<p>Step 1: Content Preparation</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/content-preparation-for-video-podcast.jpg"
                      alt="Content Preparation For Video Podcast"
                ></p>
<p>So yes, the content preparation is essential and foremost! Check the field and podcast format for which you can create the most awesome content. You must also address the target audience as your first step using various research tools, such as Facebook Groups, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, etc. You can also look at several types of podcast formats discussed above to get started.</p>
<p>Step 2: Recording</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-podcast.jpg"
                      alt="Record Podcast"
                ></p>
<p>A recording is all about using the ideal equipment and setup. It also depends upon your selection of format. For instance, a video podcast in an interview may not need the other guest as in-person if they have a virtual presence. You can record with the on-screen recorder then. Remember to follow the basics of recording, such as facing the camera and remaining in the frame.</p>
<p>Step 3: Editing</p>
<p>Now, there’s a turn to edit the raw video. Editing can be in various forms and can be time-consuming if you are not doing it right. For this purpose, a good video editor is more than crucial. Generally, you are required to adjust the audio and pop in a little video effect with interactive video intros and outros. We want to recommend you the updated and easy to use video editor, namely the Wondershare Filmora X. It has a huge list of stunning video and audio effects with an inbuilt music library to craft your podcasts in the most professional way.</p>

                > </a></p>
<p>Step 4: Publish</p>
<p>Lastly, now that you have the edited video ready publish your video podcast on your blog or online media, like YouTube, etc.</p>
