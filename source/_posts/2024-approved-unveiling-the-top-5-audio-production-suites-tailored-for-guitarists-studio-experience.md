And if you are editing videos online using a web browser, likely, you are not familiar with video editors.

## Part 3 Free Music Video Editor App

Even though online video editors do not require a powerful computer, you will still need a computer for using them. And since not everyone has a computer, this can be a huge issue for many users. However, if you upload video files on social media websites, you certainly have a smartphone with you. In that case, you will be glad to know that you can even edit videos on your mobile device. This is made possible thanks to the various free music video editor app options.

![free editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/music-editor-2.png)
