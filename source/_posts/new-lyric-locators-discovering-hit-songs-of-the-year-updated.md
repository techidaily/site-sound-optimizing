Most of us have playlists made up of songs that have been either chart-toppers or have gone viral or are immensely popular. But now and then, we come across some obscure and underrated song that suits our music taste. The song might be in a different language or from a foreign country.

We want to find those songs to put on our playlist, but we do not have enough information about them. What do you do? Just use a song identifier online service to look up the song name so that you can listen to your new favorite music again – whenever you want!

There are many song identifier online apps or music recognition online websites that will help you identify those songs. Let us know about them and learn how to use them.

## Song Identifier Online You Should Try In 2024

Depending on your preferences, and features on offer, you may want to try out one of these online song identifiers.

### 1\. [AudioTag](https://audiotag.info/)

![AudioTag song identifier  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audiotag-online-music-identifier.jpg)

AudioTag is an easy-to-use song identifier online service. You upload an audio fragment, the duration of which can be as short as 10 seconds or as long as the entire song, and then let the website's audio recognition engine do its job. After it analyses your uploaded audio file, every available information regarding that audio file, like the title of the song, artist's name, album title, etc., are extracted and put at your disposal.

The audio file you upload can be in any format, ADPCM, .WAV, .FLV, .MP3,.MP4, or other commonly used audio file formats. It can be a digitized recording from an old tape recording or a downloaded file from the internet. AudioTag can identify audio in video files too.

**Pros:**

* The service is free
* Can work with a wide range of audio file formats
* It has got a robust database that contains songs from the 1940s to present times
* The algorithm can differentiate between separate songs in a single recording
* Can identify songs in low- quality recording

* The algorithm cannot match uploaded files with songs that are melodically similar

## Quieting the Cinematic Chaos: Techniques for Audio Trimming in iMovie Videos

# How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

 Aug 18, 2022• Proven solutions

_“How do you remove audio from a video in Movie on an iPhone or Mac? I have a video, but I want to mute it before sharing it with my friends from my iPhone!”_

As a friend of mine asked me this, I realized that so many people find it hard to **separate audio from a video** in **iMovie** on iPhone or iPad. Since iMovie is available for Mac and iOS devices, it can ideally be used to edit your videos on the go. The best part is that it features various inbuilt features that you can use to remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone/iPad/Mac. In this post, I will let you know how do you remove audio from a video in iMovie on different devices.

## Part 1: How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on iPhone/iPad?

If you own an iPhone or an iPad, then you might be familiar with iMovie, which is an inbuilt video editor app, developed by Apple. If the app is not installed on your iOS device, then you can get it for free from the App Store. While there are several editing features in iMovie, it offers a dedicated option to control the audio level or remove it entirely from the video.

To learn how to remove sound from a video in iMovie on iPhone or iPad, you can follow these simple instructions:

**Step 1: Load the video to mute on your iMovie app**

At first, just get the iMovie app from the App Store on your iPhone or iPad and launch it. Once the iMovie app is launched, just tap on the “+” icon and choose to work on a new Movie project.

This will let you browse the available folders on your iPhone or iPad so that you can select the video to edit. Once you find the file, just select it, and load it on the iMovie interface by tapping on the “Create Movie” button.

**Step 2: Remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone/iPad**

After when the video is loaded, you can check its icon on the timeline and view its preview at the top. Now, just tap on the video icon from the timeline to get various options at the bottom.

From all the available options at the bottom panel, just tap on the sound icon. You can now scroll the bar left or right to adjust the level of audio in the video. Besides that, you can also tap on the sound icon from the side to remove audio from the video in iMovie on iPhone or iPad.

**Step 3: Save changes and export the edited video**

Once you have muted the sound in the video, just tap on the “Done” button to save the changes. After working on the project, you can tap on the share icon from the bottom and simply save the modified video on your iPad/iPhone.

### Pro Tip: How to Mute Background Noise in iMovie

If you want, you can instantly use iMovie to remove audio from a part of the clip on your iOS device. To do this, just locate your video on the device and open it. Now, tap on the “Edit” button on the top to get different options. From here, you can tap on the sound icon from the top to mute the audio component in the video.

## Part 2\. How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on Mac?

Just like the iOS app, you can also learn how to remove audio from a video clip in iMovie on Mac as well. Although, the Mac app of iMovie also offers several other editing features that would come in handy to you. To learn how do you remove audio from a video in iMovie on your Mac, you can follow this simple drill.

**Step 1: Import the Video you want to edit on iMovie**

To begin with, just launch the iMovie application on your Mac and choose to work on a new project. Afterward, you can drag-and-drop the video to iMovie or click on the Import button to browse and load the file here.

**Step 2: Remove audio from the video in iMovie on Mac**

After the video has been added, you can view its thumbnail from the files section. At first, just drag the video and drop it to the timeline at the bottom so that you can make the needed edits.

Once the video is loaded, you can just right-click the video thumbnail from the timeline. Now, from the provided context menu, you can simply choose to detach audio from the file.

As a friend of mine asked me this, I realized that so many people find it hard to **separate audio from a video** in **iMovie** on iPhone or iPad. Since iMovie is available for Mac and iOS devices, it can ideally be used to edit your videos on the go. The best part is that it features various inbuilt features that you can use to remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone/iPad/Mac. In this post, I will let you know how do you remove audio from a video in iMovie on different devices.

## Part 1: How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on iPhone/iPad?

If the app is not installed on your iOS device, then you can get it for free from the App Store. While there are several editing features in iMovie, it offers a dedicated option to control the audio level or remove it entirely from the video.

To learn how to remove sound from a video in iMovie on iPhone or iPad, you can follow these simple instructions:

At first, just get the iMovie app from the App Store on your iPhone or iPad and launch it. Once the iMovie app is launched, just tap on the “+” icon and choose to work on a new Movie project.

**Step 3: Save changes and export the edited video**

Once you have muted the sound in the video, just tap on the “Done” button to save the changes. After working on the project, you can tap on the share icon from the bottom and simply save the modified video on your iPad/iPhone.
