## How to Add Audio to Video Easily

### Step 2: Add a new audio file to the video

Drag the audio and video files from the media library or Audio Library and place them on the respective tracks of the timeline, namely, place the audio file to the Audio Track. This way, the audio file(s) will be merged into the video.

### Step 3: Record and add your voiceover to video

Instead of [adding music to the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can also record and add voiceover to the video. It's a fun way to add narration or complementary audio to video. To do so, click the Record button on the toolbar above timeline, the Record dialog will appear.

Click the red Record button, and you can start to talk in 3 seconds. The voiceover will be added to the User's Album and timeline when completed.

### Step 4: Replace audio track of the video

This is similar to adding audio to video. Just an extra step is required: delete the original audio file. To do so, right-click the video you want to replace audio in it, and select [Audio Detach](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). After that, delete the audio file from the track.

As described above, you can then drag and drop a new audio file from User's Album to the Audio track.
