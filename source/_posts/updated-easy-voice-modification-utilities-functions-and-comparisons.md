If you are just starting your podcast or would like to take it to another level, then you need to have the right microphone. After all, the audio quality is the most important thing in your podcast and should not be taken lightly. Thankfully, with the help of a reliable **podcast microphone**, you can certainly improve the quality of your audio. Since there are so many options out there, I have handpicked the 9 best podcast microphones at entry, intermediate, and pro levels.

* [Part 1:What to Consider while Buying a Podcast Microphone?](#part1)
* [Part 2:Top 3 Podcast Microphones at Entry level](#part3)

## What to Consider while Buying a Podcast Microphone?

To select the best podcast microphone to meet your requirements, I would recommend keeping the following things in mind.

**Consider the microphone type**

Microphones can be classified based on their placement or working. For instance, you need to decide if you want to get a podcast microphone with a stand or a handheld one. Similarly, an omnidirectional microphone would function differently than a cardioid one.

**What and where are you recording?**

Getting a microphone to record speech would be different than the one to record music. Also, consider your setup and check whether the microphone would work with your other devices. Getting a podcast with polar sensitivity is better in almost every environment.

**Check the specifications**

Furthermore, make sure that you check specifications like impedance, connectivity, working frequency, ease of use, etc. before you purchasing a microphone.

**Budget and user reviews**

Lastly, make sure that you stick to a budget while filtering podcast microphones and check the review of its existing users to make up your mind.
