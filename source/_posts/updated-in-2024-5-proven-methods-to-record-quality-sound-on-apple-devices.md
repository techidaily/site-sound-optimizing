The audio extraction process is rather simple as you just have to **upload the file** and wait for the platform to prepare your file for conversion. Afterward, you just have to **select the output format** and click on the **Start button** and once the conversion process is completed, you can save the file to a destination on your device or use the **QR code** to download it to a **Smartphone or tablet**. What’s more, you can also use the **Online Video Converter** to extract audio files from [YouTube videos](https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/mp3-converter). Simply paste the video’s URL and then proceeds to choose the output format, and click on the **More Settings** option if you want to designate **the start and end points** of the new audio file. Click on the **Start button** to commence the extraction process and use one of the available methods to download the file.

YouTubers who already have channels on the world’s largest video sharing platform can use the Video2Mp3 tool to turn their videos into MP3 files effortlessly. You don’t even have to be a registered YouTube user to convert videos stored on this platform with Video2Mp3, because you can just pick any video that is uploaded to YouTube and turn it into an MP3 file with this powerful audio extraction tool. Once you’ve pasted the video’s **URL into the platform’s URL box**, simply click on the Convert to MP3 button. You will then have to specify the preferred **output format**, or use the platform’s **Search and Convert** option that lets you search for videos on **Dailymotion, Clipfish or YouTube** and convert them. Click on the **Convert button** to initiate the conversion process, **insert the name of the artist and title** of the song you’re converting and proceed to download the video.

#### 6. [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/)

You can convert a video file with Zamzar in just three quick steps, upload a file from an online destination or from your device, **pick the output format** and click on the Convert button. Once the file is converted you can save it to your computer, however, the free version of the Zamzar platform offers only limited options. In case you would like to be able to convert files that are **larger than 200mb**, be able to **convert via email**, have access to **online storage space**, then you should **choose one of the available subscription plans**. Keep in mind that all versions of the platform **limit the concurrent number of conversions**, which means that even if you purchase a subscription plan, you are going to be able to make **25, 50 or 100** concurrent conversions each month, depending on the plan you choose.
