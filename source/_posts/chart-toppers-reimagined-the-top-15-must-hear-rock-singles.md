# Normalizing Audio in 3 Quick Ways-Audio Normalization

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

To **normalize audio** is to apply a constant amount of gain to a recording to bring the amplitude to a target or norm. Or simply put, normalizing any audio file with a normalizer software searches the file for a peak volume to set a defined maximum and then brings up the rest of the audio to the same maximum level.

**Audio normalization** is a good practice to get your audio levels right for a better-balanced video, especially imperative for dialogue clips that stand out on YouTube and other platforms. However, out of many different reasons, getting the best audio results from old-fashioned AD/DA converters or matching a group of audios on the same volume levels are still the most common.

Nevertheless, it's not always easy to find an efficient audio normalization tool and – most importantly – to master the process. But no worries because we have you covered. So, dive in to learn some of the best tools and how you can use them to create masterfully balanced soundtracks.

* [Method 1: Normalize Audio Online](#part1)
* [Method 2: Normalize Audio with Wondershare Filmora's Auto Normalization](#part2)

## FAQs about Normalizing Audio

Here we sorted out some frequently asked questions about audio normalization, which can help you learn more about **audio normalization.**

### 1\. What dB should I normalize audio to?

Well, that entirely depends on your audio use, and there is no exact number for normalizing an audio clip. However, for safety, the trick is to stay from the maximum volume level of 0 dB. For overall mix levels, most video editors recommend normalizing audio between -10 dB to -20 dB. Likewise, in the case of a dialogue clip, the recommended audio levels are -12 dB to -15 dB. Still some other suggestions are

* Music: -18 dB to -22 dB
* Soundeffects: -10 dB to -20 dB

### 2\. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?

**Audio normalization** only and purely changes the volume of a sound by applying a constant amount of gain with a goal to make the loudest peak reach 0 Db. And while normalizing also matches multiple audios to the same volume, it still does not affect the sound dynamics, unlike compression.

On the flip side, audio compression chops off the audio peaks in your recording to get a fuller, louder sound without reaching the clipping limit. In compression, you are changing a proportion of the audio over time in varying amounts.

### 3\. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?

Fortunately, no. **Audio normalization**, when appropriately done with the help of efficient audio editors, never affects the audio quality. When normalizing an audio clip, the digital bit having the highest level below 0 dB is identified, and all the other bits of the audio are amplified to the same level. This translates to no change in the relative difference between every bit, while the noise level also does not change. So, yes, the only thing affected is the output level and not the quality of the track.

#### Summing up

**Audio normalization** is an emerging trend as a good idea to manage high-quality audio levels. This feature can indeed benefit the final steps of mastering music production. However, you need to be careful when deciding where and when to **normalize audio** or avoid it for better results.

So, are you ready to level up your audio game? The above-mentioned audio editing tools are top-notch normalizers that will do the work for you. Also, don't forget to try Wondershare Filmora's distinctive auto normalization feature to produce studio-quality audio.

**Audio normalization** is a good practice to get your audio levels right for a better-balanced video, especially imperative for dialogue clips that stand out on YouTube and other platforms. However, out of many different reasons, getting the best audio results from old-fashioned AD/DA converters or matching a group of audios on the same volume levels are still the most common.

Nevertheless, it's not always easy to find an efficient audio normalization tool and – most importantly – to master the process. But no worries because we have you covered. So, dive in to learn some of the best tools and how you can use them to create masterfully balanced soundtracks.

## FAQs about Normalizing Audio

Here we sorted out some frequently asked questions about audio normalization, which can help you learn more about **audio normalization.**

### 1\. What dB should I normalize audio to?

Well, that entirely depends on your audio use, and there is no exact number for normalizing an audio clip. However, for safety, the trick is to stay from the maximum volume level of 0 dB. For overall mix levels, most video editors recommend normalizing audio between -10 dB to -20 dB. Likewise, in the case of a dialogue clip, the recommended audio levels are -12 dB to -15 dB. Still some other suggestions are

* Music: -18 dB to -22 dB
* Soundeffects: -10 dB to -20 dB

### 2\. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?

**Audio normalization** only and purely changes the volume of a sound by applying a constant amount of gain with a goal to make the loudest peak reach 0 Db. And while normalizing also matches multiple audios to the same volume, it still does not affect the sound dynamics, unlike compression.

On the flip side, audio compression chops off the audio peaks in your recording to get a fuller, louder sound without reaching the clipping limit. In compression, you are changing a proportion of the audio over time in varying amounts.

### 3\. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?

Fortunately, no. **Audio normalization**, when appropriately done with the help of efficient audio editors, never affects the audio quality. When normalizing an audio clip, the digital bit having the highest level below 0 dB is identified, and all the other bits of the audio are amplified to the same level. This translates to no change in the relative difference between every bit, while the noise level also does not change. So, yes, the only thing affected is the output level and not the quality of the track.

#### Summing up

**Audio normalization** is an emerging trend as a good idea to manage high-quality audio levels. This feature can indeed benefit the final steps of mastering music production. However, you need to be careful when deciding where and when to **normalize audio** or avoid it for better results.

So, are you ready to level up your audio game? The above-mentioned audio editing tools are top-notch normalizers that will do the work for you. Also, don't forget to try Wondershare Filmora's distinctive auto normalization feature to produce studio-quality audio.

## What Is Distortion in Audio?

You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.

Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.

While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.

A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.

In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.

## The Difference Between Noise and Distortion

Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let's look at the differences between noise and distortion.

#### 1\. Where It Appears in a Signal

Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.

#### 2\. How It Affects Signals

Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.

#### How It's Measured

You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal's waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal's magnitude and frequency content over time.

Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.

## How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video

You can use several different methods to remove audio distortion in your video. They include:

Whether you are in the business of shooting or editing, noisy or distorted footage is among the most frustrating roadblocks you'll ever encounter in your workflow. The magic of filmmaking lies after the scenes in post-production. You can remove distortion from audio using various methods.

## What Is Distortion in Audio?

You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.

Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.

While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.

A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.

In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.

## The Difference Between Noise and Distortion

Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let's look at the differences between noise and distortion.

#### 1\. Where It Appears in a Signal

Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.

#### 2\. How It Affects Signals

Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.

#### How It's Measured

You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal's waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal's magnitude and frequency content over time.

Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.

## How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video

You can use several different methods to remove audio distortion in your video. They include:

### Method 1: Use an Online Audio Distortion Tool

You can use an online distortion tool to fix this problem. One of the popular tools for removing distortion from audio is Audacity. Available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other Unix-like operating systems, Audacity is a FOSS (free and open-source digital audio editor software). It is also a recording application software, and you can use the program for varying tasks, including conversing audio files, removing audio distortion, adding effects, and mixing audio clips.

Keeping this in mind, let's look at how to remove distortion from audio using Audacity.

1. The first step is opening the file. To do this, drag and drop the audio file into Audacity.
1. Next, you need to select the distorted area before clicking on Effect. Once you have done this, click on the Noise Reduction option.

![remove audio distortion from video using audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/remove-distortion-from-audio-1.png)
