## Part 2: What is MP3/MP4?

MP3 is short for MPEG (Moving Pictures Experts Group) Layer 3, an audio file format for storing digital audio data on a computer system. There are three types of audio file format:

* Uncompressed audio format: such as WAV, AIFF, AU etc.
* Lossless compressed audio format: .ape, .m4a etc.
* Lossy compressed audio format: MP3

Here is a comparision table. it is helpful to understand MP3 to MP4.

| File extension | Format | Handles              | Standards                  | Portability                      |               |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| MP3            | .mp3   | audio                | audio                      | ISO/IEC 11172-3, ISO/IEC 13818-3 | almost all    |
| MP4            | .mp4   | multimedia container | audio, video, text, images | ISO/IEC 14496-14                 | iPods/iPhones |

MP3 files are compressed to approximately 1/10 the original size of the music file without a corresponding decrease in fidelity and perceived audio quality. Therefore it’s rather small in size, making it very easy to download, transfer and share. Converting MP3 to any other music formats is also possible by using appropriate conversion software programs, so it it easy to conver MP3 to MP4 with a right converter.  
  
MP4 and MP3 sure sound familiar and it's possible that some may think that MP4 might be the next step for MP3\. However that’s not the case. Indeed they are quite different in that MP4, which is short for MPEG-4, is a multimedia container format, used to store audio, and/or video data, as well as other data such as subtitles as well as images etc.
  
The biggest difference between them is that MP3 can only store audio, whereas MP4 can store multiple formats of multimedia files.

It is another program that allows you to convert the files with perfection. The best part is that it allows the users to overcome the issues that the other programs present. With minimal system requirements, it is highly regarded as one of the best programs of all time.

There is a hoard of formats i.e. 1000+ to be precise that is supported by this software. It is highly diligent and allows the users to get the results with perfection and ease.

**Pros**

* The basic editing can also be performed by the program instead of just conversion.
* The 2 audio track conversions are also supported by the program which is not found in many other converters.

**Cons**

* The media info section of the program is useless as it does not display the desired information.
* The batch processing of the conversion is not supported by the program which consumes time and effort.

## Conclusion

You see, the process of MP3 to MP4 conversion is highly simplified with Filmora because the actions are actually pretty simple even for those who are just starting to acquire computer skills. Besides converting, this MP3 to MP4 converter is also equipped with plenty of useful features, such as trim, rotate, crop video, add loge to video, change audio volume, pitch, set fade in/fade out effect, etc. Now explore more functions by yourself!
