If you don’t want to keep the video file, right-click it and choose “Delete” to remove it from the video timeline.

#### 3. Edit the extracted audio if you like

Double click the extracted file in the audio track and then you will see the audio editing panel.

You can add fade-in and fade-out effects, [change the sound volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjust the pitch to [change the voice](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), etc. as you like.
