## Part 3 Song Modification For Copyright Immunity

According to some individuals, copyright and related actions take place because of identical similarities between the two files. Due to this, they think if they modify some parts of audio by making changes in pitch, tempo, and some other technical changes, they can use it without any problem. This technique might appear useful for some individuals while using a common thing.

If someone detects such a kind of modification or violation of copyright policy, you may face some strict actions too. According to the YouTube Library rules, you can modify or use a copyrighted audio file by taking permission from the copyright holder only. In case you do something without having permission, it will be considered an illegal act and a violation of platform policy. The copyright holder can also take action as he or she wants. It will be good if you choose the files that are available with YouTube audio library free download options only.
