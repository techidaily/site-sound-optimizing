## Part 1: Record Voiceover and Add it to Video

In most cases, we recommend you to record the voiceover first so the sound will be more natural. In the following part, I'll show you how to record Voiceover in Filmora.

#### 1\. Connect Microphone to Computer

Plug the microphone into your computer when you’re ready to get started. It's better to use some professional external [microphones to capture high quality sound.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 2\. Record voiceover

Installing Filmora on your computer, click the Wondershare Filmora icon to launch it. In the starting interface, click New Project to create a new one. Go to the Record tab, and then click “Record a Voiceover ” option to arouse the Record Audio windows.

#### 4\. Sync Voiceover to Video

Now, it’s time to sync the recorded voiceover to video to make a video. Since Filmora supports up to 100 audio tracks, you can now [add some background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)to the voiceover as well.

Then import and drag-n-drop the video footage to the video track, drag and drop the sound track to the right position to fit your video. You can keep the audio and video track in the same length if needed.

Note: If you’ve recorded the voiceover on your iPhone or other device already, and want to add it to the video, you can import it in the Project Library and then sync it to video.

To attract viewer’s attention, sometimes, you may need to add some titles or subtitles to emphasis the key points. Here is the detailed steps about how to add titles to video.

Place the Playhead to the position where you need a voiceover, and then click the Microphone icon in the toolbar to start.

As before, the recorded voiceover will be added to the audio track automatically.

Note: To start a new record on the Timeline, you don't need to close the dialog, just move the Time Indicator to another position and record a new voiceover.

#### 3\. Edit voiceover and Export

Just like what we said before, you can then edit the recorded voiceover to fit the video perfectly and then export it to your computer or upload to YouTube directly.
