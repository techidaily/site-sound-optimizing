![choose a Google voice number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/google-voice-recording-4.jpg)

Once you choose a new number, you have to verify your account with the existing number. Enter your mobile number and click on ‘Send Code’ to receive a verification code. The app’s algorithm will generate a six-digit code and send it to your existing number. Use this code to verify your identity.

### 3\. Set Up Incoming Call Recordings

Still, there is a step left to record your calls. You need to go to mobile settings and enable call recording. To enable call recordings, you need to click on the menu icon and navigate to the ‘settings’ from the sidebar menu. Now select the ‘Incoming calls options’ and turn on the recordings.

### 4\. Record Incoming Calls

After completing the setup, you can record incoming calls on your phone using Google Voice. However, every time you receive a call, you must open the dial pad and press 4 to start recording. As soon as you start recording, the caller will receive a verbal alert that notifies that the call is on recording mode. You can stop recording by pressing 4 one more time. This will also inform the user that you stopped the recording.

### 5\. Access Recordings

You can easily check voice recordings for each call. All you need to do is open the last call details and press ‘Voicemail’. This will expand the list of recordings. Now tap on the play button and listen to the audio.

### 6\. Save Transcripts

When you record your calls with Google Voice, the recordings will save in the app storage. However, you can save and share those recordings in your mobile phone storage by selecting the ellipsis (•••) button. You will find the button on the recording page as some options will appear on the screen. You have to choose ‘Copy transcript’ and paste it in the message or notepad. Keep in mind that you can only save transcripts of recorded calls.
