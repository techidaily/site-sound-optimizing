Although Zoom meeting is itself an amazing app with so many different features, among those features, one is that Zoom has high-quality video and audio. Besides everything, you can still improve Zoom Audio's performance by following the tips that are shared below.

### · Reduce Background Noise

Your audio performance is instantly improved if you reduce background noise. Any disturbing noise in the background falls under this category. It can be the fan, air conditioning, ticking clocks, etc. You should move away from the noise.

### · Use High-Quality Microphone

For better audio performance, use a high-quality microphone for your Zoom meetings. This factor is the most important factor when it comes to improving audio. Investing in a decent and good external microphone is never a bad option.

### · Stable Internet Connection

With a weak internet connection, your voice breaks. If you want to have improved Zoom audio performance, then make sure that you have a stable internet connection. Distortion and disturbance cause problems while communicating.

### · Distance from Microphone

You must sit at an average distance from your microphone. Sitting too close will sound like you are shouting. Whereas sitting too far, your voice is quieter, and background noise sounds loud. So, measure the appropriate distance from the microphone.
