05 [Question 5: How to Add Music from Sound Library to My Video?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What is YouTube Sound library?

Content creators are always treading the tightrope when it comes to budget. They are always watching out for a way to make their work cost-efficient by cutting costs wherever possible.

Sounds and music are some fields where you cannot afford to be cost-effective, as it is bound to hamper the quality of your final product. But buying the rights of music or sound can also have adverse effects on your purse. This is where YouTube Sound Library can save the day for you.

YouTube Sound Library is a segment of YouTube Studio dedicated to presenting content creators like you with royalty-free music from different genres, moods, and artists around the globe.

## Part 2 How to Find YouTube Sound Library?

It’s really easy to find YouTube sound effects library. It doesn’t matter if you are using a computer or a smartphone, it’s the same process that you need to follow. Here is how you can do it –

##### Step 1

First, you need to open YouTube on your browser and go to “Your Channel” by clicking on the picture icon from the top right corner.

##### Step 2

Then click on the “Customize Channel” button. This will open the YouTube Creator Studio. You can also directly go to this link and sign into your [YouTube Creator Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/).

##### Step 3

Now from the left panel scroll below the options such as “Dashboard”, “Content”, “Playlists”, etc.

You’ll find the “Audio Library” option below. Select the “Audio Library” option and you’ll get to the YouTube Sound Library.

## Part 3 Is YouTube Sound Library Free?

A simple answer to this question is: Yes, YouTube Sound Library is free. The sound or the music you procure from this medium is royalty-free. And using it won’t incur the risk of a copyright strike against your content.

But just like every Google and YouTube tool available on the internet, YouTube Sound Library also comes with a bunch of terms and conditions. As a content creator and user of the audio from the library, you will be required to keep those terms and conditions in mind before using the music. If you somehow breach the guidelines mapped out by YouTube, you run the risk of a copyright strike against your content.

Therefore, before using the audio, thoroughly go through the content usage guidelines. Although they are not rocket science to start with, not honoring them can bite you later on.

## Part 4 How Can I Use YouTube Sound Library?

Downloading YouTube audio is very easy. All you need to do is log on to your YouTube profile and access the YouTube Studio option. Once you are at it, follow these simple instructions:

## Part 5 How to Add Music from Sound Library to My Video?

Now that you have downloaded your desired music for your video, the question arises, how to integrate it into your video?

A straightforward answer to that can be, using YouTube Studio’s built-in video editor. But considering the limited features it has on offer, you might require something that can allow you to add premium features: drag and drop special effects, custom animation on the go, and much more.

So, if you are looking for such features too, then [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be the answer to your requirements. Filmora is a video editing software that allows you to perform some of the most crucial editing tasks with relative ease. From integrating music to a video, to adding special effects or custom animation and color matching in your video, Filmora has got you all covered.

### Features

● Adding background music to the video: Music makes everything merry. So, if you want your video to look stunning, you know that music is the key. Hence, Filmora comes with the feature of adding background music/sound to your video that will keep your -audience engaged and entertained throughout it-.

● Audio de-noise: As a content creator, it’s impossible to make sure that there is no noise distraction in the background every time you sit down to record a video. These background noises can be a huge distraction for your viewers and might even annoy them off. Therefore, Filmora has come up with the best de-noise feature to help you reduce the background noises in your video.

● Fade Audio in or out: Like the transition of the scenes in a video, the audio change is equally important. You cannot complete a perfect transition without a proper audio fade. Filmora offers you a more straightforward method to adjust the audio in your video during the transition.

● Beat Detection: Syncing a video has been a hassle for content creators over the years. Beat detection has, however, changed the game completely. In Filmora’s beat detection feature, you can analyze the music and generate beat markers to help you while syncing the audio and special effects.

● Adjust applied audio effects: This is another game-changing feature that helps you lengthen or shorten the length of an impact according to your video. Filmora’s Adjust Audio Effect feature allows you to delay the time of the effect and the factor of effects like echo, lobby, big room etc.

##### Step 2 For adding music to the video(s), simply drag and drop your music over the video track and position it according to the length of the video

One most significant advantage of using Filmora is that it offers you a wide array of royalty-free sounds. To access this feature, you just have to head to the Audio Library in Filmora and drag and drop the music thumbnails you want.
