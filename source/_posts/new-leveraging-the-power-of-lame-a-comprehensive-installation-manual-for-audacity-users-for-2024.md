 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Music is one of the most viewed video categories on YouTube, as millions of people worldwide use this platform to find or discover music they like. Making music videos that really stand out in the sea of similar content is far from easy, but if you are not a professional filmmaker, and you would just like to make a video quickly you can try creating music videos you share on social networks with a music visualizer. Most of the music visualizers you can find online enable you to select an [audio spectrum template](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), pick the style of the visualization or even add logos or links to your social media accounts. So, in this article we are going to take you through the five best music visualizers you can use to create music videos that are going to get a lot of likes and shares on social media in 2024\. You will learn:

* [**Part 1: What Is Music Visualization?**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: How Does Music Visualization Work?**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Best Music Visualizers in 2024**](#part3)

## Part 1: What Is Music Visualization?

The conversion of sounds into imagery is often referred to as music visualization, and since the mid-1970 a number of different electronic and media player software visualizers have been used to generate animated images from a musical composition.

## Part 2: How Does Music Visualization Work?

The techniques used to visualize sound can vary from very simple ones like a simulation of an oscilloscope display, to highly complex ones that involve a number of composite effects. Media players like Winamp or VLC have built-in sound visualization features that are based on the song’s frequency spectrum and loudness. Nearly all music visualizations take place in real-time, which is the reason why VJ artists often use music visualization software to create their artwork. However, over the course of the last couple of decades, music visualization has gotten so popular that in 2019 you can even visualize your favorite songs online, without the use of any additional software.

## Part 3: Best Music Visualizers in 2024

If you already have the music you would like to visualize, then it is time for you to start browsing through some of the best music visualizers that are currently available on the markets.

The conversion of sounds into imagery is often referred to as music visualization, and since the mid-1970 a number of different electronic and media player software visualizers have been used to generate animated images from a musical composition.

Media players like Winamp or VLC have built-in sound visualization features that are based on the song’s frequency spectrum and loudness. Nearly all music visualizations take place in real-time, which is the reason why VJ artists often use music visualization software to create their artwork.

Most of the music visualizers you can find online enable you to select an [audio spectrum template](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), pick the style of the visualization or even add logos or links to your social media accounts. So, in this article we are going to take you through the five best music visualizers you can use to create music videos that are going to get a lot of likes and shares on social media in 2024\. You will learn:

* [**Part 2: How Does Music Visualization Work?**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Best Music Visualizers in 2024**](#part3)
* [**Part 4: Easier Ways to Create Music Visualization Videos**](#part4)

## Part 1: What Is Music Visualization?

The conversion of sounds into imagery is often referred to as music visualization, and since the mid-1970 a number of different electronic and media player software visualizers have been used to generate animated images from a musical composition.

## Part 2: How Does Music Visualization Work?

The techniques used to visualize sound can vary from very simple ones like a simulation of an oscilloscope display, to highly complex ones that involve a number of composite effects. Media players like Winamp or VLC have built-in sound visualization features that are based on the song’s frequency spectrum and loudness. Nearly all music visualizations take place in real-time, which is the reason why VJ artists often use music visualization software to create their artwork. However, over the course of the last couple of decades, music visualization has gotten so popular that in 2019 you can even visualize your favorite songs online, without the use of any additional software.

## Part 3: Best Music Visualizers in 2024

If you already have the music you would like to visualize, then it is time for you to start browsing through some of the best music visualizers that are currently available on the markets. Nearly all of the music visualizers we featured in this article offer free trial versions that have a limited scope of visualization and exporting options, but enable you to see if the music visualizer meets all of your demands. Let’s have a look at the five best music visualizers of 2024.

#### 1. [Renderforest Music Visualizer](https://www.renderforest.com/music-visualizer.html)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start at $9.99

**Compatibility:** Online

Renderforest is a platform that helps its users create visual content online, or even design an entire website. However, in order to start visualizing your music with Renderforest, you must first register and create your own account. Afterward, you just have to choose between visualization templates with text or photo holders, add the artist’s name and the title of the song and add the background photo or video. You can then proceed to pick the style of the visualization that matches the music perfectly, select its color and finally upload a song you would like to use in your video. When done, you should simply click on the Preview icon and the Renderforest will send you the email that contains the music visualization video. Keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of the platform are going to be watermarked and that their duration can’t exceed a one-minute limit.

#### 2. [Videobolt Music Visualizer](https://videobolt.net/music-visualizer)

**Price:** Free trial available, Subscription plans start from $7.99 per month

**Compatibility:** Online

The collection of music visualization templates this website offers is truly impressive, as you can choose from a wide variety of templates during the process of creating a video. However, you must purchase one of the available subscription plans in order to be able to customize the template you’ve selected and export a watermark-free video. After you’ve selected a music visualization template you just have to click on the Edit button below it to start working on your project. You can either upload a song from your computer or use SoundCloud to import a song you would like to visualize into the project. Adding cover art or using a variation of the template you originally selected can improve the quality of your video. The only downside is that you won’t be able to customize videos produced by Videobolt Music Visualizer during the free trial period.

#### 3. [Magic Music Visuals](https://magicmusicvisuals.com/)

**Price:** Free demo available, $44,95 for a full version license

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

VJs and all other artists who like to mix sound and images during live sessions can use the Performer edition of this cross-platform music visualization software. The Studio edition offers all features that are necessary for the creation of real-time music visualizations or music videos. You can use both editions of Magic to generate 2D and 3D graphics that react to the music or mix together photos, 3D files or videos. Moreover, you can easily enter the full-screen mode and project your videos using LED displays or projectors. The Magic Music Visuals also enables its users to combine an unlimited number of audio inputs simultaneously, which means that you can mix two or more songs effortlessly. This music visualization software lets you export videos in mp4 and mov files, but the length of the rendering process depends on how long the video is and on the processing power of the computer you’re using.

#### 4. [VSDC Video Editor Free - Audio Spectrum Visualizer](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

Visualizing music is just one out of countless video editing options VDSC Video Editor Free offers. Besides the creation of videos based on music, you can also use this video editing software product to stabilize videos recorded with action cameras, enhance the colors in the footage captured with a wide array of cameras and drones, create 3D charts or export videos in high resolution to your accounts on social media directly from the software. The editor’s audio visualizer contains five hundred presets you can use to create a captivating music video for your latest song. Besides the Spectrum feature that displays the sounds within a set color range, the VDSC Video Editor also offers the Audio Abstraction option that generates colorful abstract shapes based on the music you select. Even though visualizing sound with VDSC’s audio visualizer is a fun and simple process, video creators with no previous video editing experience may need a little time to get used to the software’s interface.

#### 5. [After Effects - The Audio Spectrum Effect](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

**Price:** $20,99 per month as a single app or $52,99 as a part of the All Apps subscription model

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

There isn’t virtually anything related to digital visual effects, motion graphics or compositing you can’t do in Adobe After Effects. That is why it is hardly surprising that you can also use the After Effects to visualize the music, but you must have at least basic knowledge of the software in order to be able to that. Before you can apply the Audio Spectrum effect you must first create a new composition, add the sound file to that composition and set its duration. If these tasks sound too complicated, you should take your time and slowly learn how to use the basic functionalities of Adobe After Effects. More experienced video editors can use The Audio Spectrum effect’s settings to try out different styles of music visualization and explore creative ways of making their videos more dynamic.

## Part 4: Create Audio Spectrum Visualizer Video in Filmora Video Editor \[Step by Step\]

Then you can make the audio file fit your video by trimming or double click the audio file to set fade in/out effects, speed up or slow down it, adjust volume so that it doesn't drown out the original audio of your video, etc. If you want to remove the original audio, just right click the video in Timeline and select “Audio Detach” and press “Delete” to remove audio from video.

 Besides adding an audio file, you can also use Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) to record and add your own voiceover. To do this, simply click the “Record” button on the toolbar and record the voiceover in the Record Audio window. Click the red button to get started and “OK” to save it and return to the main interface. The recorded voiceover will then appear in the audio track. Then adjust its position, volume, etc., just like any audio files.

#### 3 Export the new MKV file

 After adding audio, click “Play” to preview and listen to the new file. Then click “Create” to export your MKV file. Here are various choices for you: export the video to various video formats, convert the video to play on different mobile devices, upload the video to YouTube instantly or burn video to DVD disc. Select a desired output way and hit “Create” to start exporting the video file with the added audio.
