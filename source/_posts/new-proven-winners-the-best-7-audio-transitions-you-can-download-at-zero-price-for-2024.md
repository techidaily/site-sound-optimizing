When you’re putting together any video production, the sound effects need to be on point. If not, you’ll find that it’s difficult to draw people in and keep their attention for long periods.

If you feel the audio track is mild or too harsh compared to the rest of the audio series, change each audio track's volume separately.

##### Step1 Select Audio Track Mixer

Click Window selects Audio Track Mixer from the menu.

##### Step2 Click the series name to see the audio mixer

Click the series name of your audio file to show the audio mixer for your series.

##### Step4 Click on the slider

### Tips

Always keep the audio projects within the -6 to 3 dB volume range to get the best quality of the audio effect. Any lower you won’t be able to hear the sound, or if it’s higher, the sound will hurt the listeners’ ears.

Professional advice to all beginner-level videographers is that as Premiere Pro is complex so you need more straightforward tools like Filmora for all your video editing work. Filmora is easy to use and much cheaper than Premiere Pro.
