### 1\. Rhythm and Tempo

The most significant thing to notice is the rhythm and tempo of the music. The instrumental music comes at different speeds. The piano, guitar, cello, guitar, violin, and harmonica can create nuisance and be slowed down as per the player. It is important to choose royalty-free instrumental music whose tempo syncs with the video.

### 2\. Content-Type of Video

The type of content in the video is essential to be studied. It is because the right information will lead to the right choice. If the video content is a product promo or description, there is nothing wrong with going a little high with tempo. However, if the video genre is business-related, avoid MP3 instrumental music with more movement and energy.

### 3\. Targeted Audience and their Preference

For the audience, one should know their preferences. Conduct market research to know what your viewers respond to. You can also watch your competitors' videos to understand their reactions to different instrumental music. The background instrumental music should be according to the audience's needs to engage them better.

### 4\. Frequency and Tone

The frequency and tone of the music matter with the video. If the video has more dialogues and talking, the users should pick the instrumental background music with the same notes as human voices. The emotional tones of the guitar, violin, cello, viola, and keyboard would help in this situation as they would complement the voice in the video.

### 5\. Video Length

The video length is yet another important pointer while selecting copyright-free instrumental music. If the video is big, the instrumental background music to fill it won't last long. Therefore, pick instrumental music that syncs with the video length. You can also use the 30 or 60 seconds loop version to continue the background instrumental track.

### 6\. Video Message

As far as the video's message is concerned, it is recommended to keep the content in mind while making a choice. The MP3 instrumental music includes five classes such as percussion, woodwind, brass, keyboard, and string. Make sure that your video story is not neglected with your music choice.
