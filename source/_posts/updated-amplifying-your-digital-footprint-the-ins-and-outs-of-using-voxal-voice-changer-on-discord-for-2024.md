## Part 1: Some Basic Recording-Level Considerations One Should Make to Avoid Noise in Videos

The advancements in AI technology have made noise reduction seamless. Although, there are some pre-recording measures one can take to minimize noise. This section on **reducing background noise in iMovie** will mention those measures. The following primary considerations can make a big difference in terms of noise:

### 1\. Pick the Right Location

If you are recording an audio or video, the first step is to choose the right surroundings. Although no location can be completely noise-free, one can try. Places with less population and more nature are noise-free as usual. Book a studio for video or audio recording, as you don't need much effort. They offer pre-arranged setups and space, which also includes noise-canceling equipment.

### 2\. Microphone Quality and Position

For professional-grade audio and video creation, the microphone is a necessity. A high-quality microphone is proficient in providing high-quality sound. There are two microphone options: an external microphone or a device-integrated microphone. Moreover, the position and settings of microphones determine the clarity of voice. If the microphone is set closer to the speaker, it will deliver a decent speech sound.

### 3\. Wind Protection and Interference

The noise of wind is an obstacle for everyone who prefers outdoor shoots. It not only declines audio clarity but annoys the viewers. To reduce wind noise, use a windscreen or furry cover. To avoid other types of interference, keep the recorder away from electrical devices. This may include smartphones, laptops, and similar devices.

### 4\. Audio and Gain Levels

While recording, it is important to keep track of audio levels for improvement. Creators can use headphones to detect audio levels and maintain unwanted noises. In addition, we advise you to set the gain at an appropriate level for clarity. A high gain value can decline audio quality through noise and other distortions.

### 5\. Right Formats and Editing

Before you start recording, make sure to choose a high-quality audio format. The popular and widely used high-quality formats are WAV and FLAC. Moreover, choose the right editing software that has noise reduction ability. The software should also retain audio quality during and after editing. These tools also offer audio enhancement effects that can do the trick.

## Part 1: Some Basic Recording-Level Considerations One Should Make to Avoid Noise in Videos

The advancements in AI technology have made noise reduction seamless. Although, there are some pre-recording measures one can take to minimize noise. This section on **reducing background noise in iMovie** will mention those measures. The following primary considerations can make a big difference in terms of noise:

### 1\. Pick the Right Location

If you are recording an audio or video, the first step is to choose the right surroundings. Although no location can be completely noise-free, one can try. Places with less population and more nature are noise-free as usual. Book a studio for video or audio recording, as you don't need much effort. They offer pre-arranged setups and space, which also includes noise-canceling equipment.

### 2\. Microphone Quality and Position

For professional-grade audio and video creation, the microphone is a necessity. A high-quality microphone is proficient in providing high-quality sound. There are two microphone options: an external microphone or a device-integrated microphone. Moreover, the position and settings of microphones determine the clarity of voice. If the microphone is set closer to the speaker, it will deliver a decent speech sound.

### 3\. Wind Protection and Interference

The noise of wind is an obstacle for everyone who prefers outdoor shoots. It not only declines audio clarity but annoys the viewers. To reduce wind noise, use a windscreen or furry cover. To avoid other types of interference, keep the recorder away from electrical devices. This may include smartphones, laptops, and similar devices.

While recording, it is important to keep track of audio levels for improvement. Creators can use headphones to detect audio levels and maintain unwanted noises. In addition, we advise you to set the gain at an appropriate level for clarity. A high gain value can decline audio quality through noise and other distortions.

### 5\. Right Formats and Editing

Before you start recording, make sure to choose a high-quality audio format. The popular and widely used high-quality formats are WAV and FLAC. Moreover, choose the right editing software that has noise reduction ability. The software should also retain audio quality during and after editing.
