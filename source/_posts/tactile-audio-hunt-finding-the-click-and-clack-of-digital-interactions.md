### **Step 2**: Add background music to the video

Drag the imported video files from the album to the tracks on the Timeline one by one. Make sure that they are arranged according to the play order and without overlapping. Then drag and drop the music files to the track above the video track. Now you can trim it and adjust the position to fit for your video length. When you set the position, you can check the previewing window and fine-tune it in real-time.

One of the benefits of using background music with Filmora is that there is a royalty-free Audio library that provides different genres of background music and sound effects. So, if you don’t want to find and download music from websites, just check the Audio Library in Filmora. Click the music thumbnail in the Media pane, and then drag and drop it to the track in the timeline pane.

**Editing audio tips**: Double click the music file in the track to pop up the audio editing panel. Here, you can do more audio edit like add fade-in/fade-out effect, adjust volume, tune the pitch, set up Audio Equalizer, etc. With Filmora, you can also change the audio speed separately to make a fast forward or slow-motion effect or apply reverse speed to playback the audio in reverse.

### **Step 3**: Export your video with a music file

When you're satisfied with the result, hit "Export" to export your video. In the pop-up window that appears, choose to save any file format you like.

Besides exporting video on your computer, you can also create a video for devices like the iPhone, iPad, or directly upload the video to YouTube and Vimeo, or burn to DVD for playing on TV. All can be achieved with this all-in-one video editor, no extra software required. If you want to loop background music, you just need to drag the background music clip to the same length of the video clip. So easy to do it!
