## Breakdown of Job Functions in the World of Movie-Making

When shooting a small-scale video, only one person handles all department workings. He or she works not only as a director, but also a cinematographer and the camera operator.

However, as the production grows and needs large-scale filming, more specific members are needed for different departments. Whether you want to set up a filming studio, or join a movie-making workshop, you'd better figure out the entire composition of the film crew and choose the best one according to your capabilities.

To simplify the scenario, we have divided the crew into these major departments, as shown below, with their work areas.

## What Is the Role of a Producer?

### 3\. Find the gear

Producers found the gear for the studio space and handled the renting of the equipment from the warehouse.

### 4\. Build relationships with the industries

If the filming is starting and you don't know who to choose, you should build a relationship with the appropriate people in the industry. So that when you are in trouble, you can call them off to get the solution.

* Split Screen Functionality: This is a highly useful feature that comes in handy when you have multiple videos on your hands that you can play at the same time. You just need to select the split-screen icon on the home menu, and select as many numbers of screens you want, and in any particular order you need.
* Audio Separation: This is one of the key features of Filmora that makes it stand out from its competitors. As the name suggests, this feature lets you separate any audio clip from a video, and then save it as a file that can further be added to another video.
* Social Import: Filmora understands the modern trends, and provides options to directly import videos from social media channels, edit it, add sound effects and then upload it back to social media within no time. This saves you from a lot of hassle of downloading the video first and makes your job easier.
