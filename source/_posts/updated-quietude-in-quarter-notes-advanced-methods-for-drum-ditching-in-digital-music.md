* Loading and editing audio
* Recording new tracks
* Mixing and applying effects
* Mastering
* Exporting finished mixes

After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song. The process will have a lot of clicking and file management that will take time and extra effort. With a web app drum extractor, the process is super easy. Take [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/), for instance, users extract drums from any public media URL in minutes.

Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.

* 4k (cymbals)
* 90 Hz (kick drum)
* 150 Hz (snare drum)

Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.

The journalists, influencers, celebrities, and a friend of yours, everyone has a podcast! Even though the podcast is there for a decade, it is becoming highly famous now. It all started in 2005 when Apple announced broadcasting podcasts. There were radios before podcasting, and still, they are there!

![Video Podcasting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-podcasting.jpg)

We are now talking about **video podcasts** in the best possible manner. Is it worth creating video when it is primarily for audio format? Yes, it is not that easy as it seems to be! There are many versions to create video podcasts. Turning on a video while making a podcast is quite smart as now you have the required video content to post on YouTube. But that would be painful if you can't hold the audience's attention for more than five minutes. Visually compelling contents seem to be very important, especially when hosting your podcast on a central social platform such as YouTube.

Stay tuned as we are going to unleash the required elements to make the best video podcasts!

* [Part1: What is a Video Podcast?](#part1)
* [Part2: Video Podcast v/s Vlog: What’s the Difference?](#part2)
* [Part3: Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting](#part3)
* [Part4: How to create a Video Podcast?](#part4)

## What is a Video Podcast?

In simple words, a video podcast is generally a video format of audio podcasts. Overall, it is video content than mere audio content. Thus, they can't listen to MP3 players. You must have a high-end digital media player, iTunes, and other video hosting platforms to listen to these kinds of podcasts. You can call it by a different name like vodcasting or videocasting as well. It is a version of podcasting despite other formats or versions of podcasts, including interview format, startup format, etc.

## Video Podcast v/s Vlog: What’s the Difference?

There is a visual difference between a vlog and a video podcast. Even though you can share both the content formats on a robust platform like YouTube, a video podcast is still different from a vlog in many terms.

**Type of Content**

The very first Difference is the type of content posted on both platforms. Vlogging is a kind of informal content presentation, whereas a vodcast is presented most formally in different versions.

**Style**

The vloggers generally show their lifestyles in various forms while also spreading social messages in some of their videos. A vlog may or may not be informative to the audience. On the other hand, a video podcaster is obliged to present its audience with informative content. Whether in the version of a startup, interview, conversational, or a repurposed content, almost every video podcast is highly instructive.

**Type of Versions**

You can have a video podcast in different versions or formats, including Interviews, Startup Conversations, Laptop Lifestyles, First Launch Conversations, Solo/ Monologue, Co-Hosting, or Hosting Regular Show. On the other hand, vlogging comes in various versions or types, namely Lifestyle, Makeup, Gaming, Fitness, Unboxing, and Reviews. It is generally informally represented to showcase reality to the audience.

## Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting

There are many such merits and demerits of video podcasts if you decide to do it on a large scale. As mentioned earlier, it won't be that easy if you are not consistent and committed. It will also help if you consider the following advantages and disadvantages of video podcasting as follows.

Pros of Video Podcasts

**Easy Accessibility**

An easy reach and wide accessibility is the first significant advantage of hosting a podcast. Every second person nowadays is fond of listening to podcasts, whether in audio or video formats. A podcast is a whole pack of informational content that doesn’t need further FAQs and similar issues to mention separately. On the other hand, accessibility is also comprehensive as everyone is utilizing the platform like YouTube.

A video podcast is the better alternative if you don't have the required setup and budget to promote your business operations.

**Convenient**

Podcasts or Video Podcasts are more convenient options, especially on YouTube. Despite getting high value, a video podcast can listen everywhere when you have YouTube. Due to convenience, they are pretty similar to listening to an audio podcast, which is also free of cost except for your internet charges. A YouTube-hosted video podcast doesn't need a paid subscription.

**Encourages productivity**

The very idea of presenting a podcast is to offer authentic information formally. It doesn't matter what format you choose to host the best video podcast; it contains reliable information and the elements to encourage productivity in viewers' minds.

Cons of Video Podcasts

**The challenging process of finding a relevant audience**

It may be super tough to find the relevant audience in the beginning. You may have to advertise on YouTube to see the audience. Else, a strategic marketing policy for your channel to ensure consistency and retention of followers or audience.

**Time Consuming**

Making a video podcast is generally a time-consuming procedure, specifically when you are new to the technical aspects. Well, a person who is passionate about podcasting can even hire a video editor to fulfill the editing and similar tasks. But that won't be beneficial in the long run. It's essential to learn video podcasting and further video editing to cut costs on a long-term basis.

**Distracting**

You should not create a podcast if it is distracting the audience within the first five minutes. That's the primary concern as creating visually appealing video podcasts is more than challenging, especially for a beginner. Due to the podcasting hype, many creators develop video podcasts that are not even useful and highly distracting for the audience.

## How to create a Video Podcast?

Let’s review the step-by-step guide to create a video podcast, as mentioned below!

Step 1: Content Preparation

You must also address the target audience as your first step using various research tools, such as Facebook Groups, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, etc. You can also look at several types of podcast formats discussed above to get started.

Step 2: Recording

![Record Podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-podcast.jpg)

A recording is all about using the ideal equipment and setup. It also depends upon your selection of format. For instance, a video podcast in an interview may not need the other guest as in-person if they have a virtual presence. You can record with the on-screen recorder then. Remember to follow the basics of recording, such as facing the camera and remaining in the frame.

Step 3: Editing

Now, there's a turn to edit the raw video. Editing can be in various forms and can be time-consuming if you are not doing it right. For this purpose, a good video editor is more than crucial.

So you're all set: you've sat down, grabbed your microphone, fired up your recording software, and started pouring out the content of your mind. Once finished, you listen back to the recording, thinking you're about to hear the silky-smooth undertones of your voice resonating through your ears, but something odd occurs — it sounds terrible. Distorted audio is very unwelcoming since you want the sound to be natural. This guide will explain how to fix distorted audio using various methods.

#### In this article

01 [What Causes Distorted Audio?](#part1)

02 [How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods](#part2)

## What Causes Distorted Audio?

Distorted audio is the main culprit in ruined audio clips. Here are some of the causes of distorted sound.

#### 1\. Recording Environment

Not recording dialogue and voice-over in a studio can cause distorted audio. However, audio quality can be out of control if you conduct an onsite interview. Getting a meaningful and cinematic shot should come first. If you do not use a studio-quality microphone that comes with directional controls, you'll likely have distorted audio. You might want to go for a unidirectional stereo channel if you want boom movements to be undetectable.

When a cheap, low-quality microphone is moving, you'll hear the unsteadiness in your recording, leading to distorted audio. Recording audio in an echo chamber or an overly large room can also result in distorted audio.

#### 2\. Touching the Mic While Recording

If you hand the microphone to someone who does not know how to use it, they might hold it too loosely or close. Microphones feature sensitive parts that should not be dropped, shaken, or breathed on. When you are interviewing people unfamiliar with industry standards, you should hold the microphone, not the person you are interviewing. The mic is not within the range of 6" to 12 " away from the speaker, this could lead to distorted audio.

#### 3\. Using the Wrong Mic

A reliable mic comes with audio controls and captures room tone and timbre. It should be portable, compact, and have a wind sleeve. In outdoor situations where ADR is not an option, you might want to use a wind sleeve.

Podcast showrunners and content creators often use Blue Yeti mics connected to a soundboard. While these are cheaper options, they can cause distorted audio. Content creators who are not stationary should purchase a lavalier, and wireless is a more high-end and expensive option.

#### 4\. Positioning Your Microphones Incorrectly

You have to be careful if you'll be mounting a mic on your DSLR. Filming events with a one-mic setup is a promise to record everything you hear again. You'll inevitably film some moments at a distance and leave the audio compromised to distortion.

#### 5\. Faulty Equipment

Your equipment can fail in different ways. For instance, your effects processor can fail, meaning that you won't hear any sound passing through it. It can also fail, and you end up hearing a distorted sound passing out of the processor. Essentially, this might or might not be linked to the component's capability of handling the signal as much as the busted internals result.

## How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods

You can fix distorted audio using various methods. They include:

### Method 1: How To Fix Distorted Audio in Audacity

Audacity is the bread and butter for individuals who adore a crisp audio quality. Audacity helps users finetune various attributes of their recordings. It is a free and intuitive software suite suitable for newbies and individuals who don't interact with computers. With that in mind, here is how to fix distorted audio using Audacity.

1. Open the audio file by dragging and dropping it into Audacity.
2. Select the distorted part and click on the Effect option. Then, select Noise Reduction.

2. Next, select the entire audio and open the Noise Reduction Window again ( Effect > Noise Reduction ). Then, set the values to suit your preferences.
3. Hit preview to check the audio, then the Click OK button.

If the audio is still distorted, apply the filter again. Don't overdo the process numerous times to ensure your audio is not degraded, making the voice sound robotic and tinny.

Now, use compression to your advantage. If compression confuses you, think of it as a tool that adjusts your audio for the listener's benefit. Compression not only quiets the background minutiae that creeps into your recording, but it also boosts your voice and gives it a full, captivating resonance.

1. To start the compression process, select your audio track, press CTRL + A, click "Effect" and then click "Compressor."

![compress your audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-4.png)

2. Once you have set the values, hit the Preview button to check the audio. Then, click on OK.

So you're all set: you've sat down, grabbed your microphone, fired up your recording software, and started pouring out the content of your mind. Once finished, you listen back to the recording, thinking you're about to hear the silky-smooth undertones of your voice resonating through your ears, but something odd occurs — it sounds terrible. Distorted audio is very unwelcoming since you want the sound to be natural. This guide will explain how to fix distorted audio using various methods.

01 [What Causes Distorted Audio?](#part1)

02 [How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods](#part2)

## What Causes Distorted Audio?

Distorted audio is the main culprit in ruined audio clips. Here are some of the causes of distorted sound.

#### 1\. Recording Environment

Not recording dialogue and voice-over in a studio can cause distorted audio. However, audio quality can be out of control if you conduct an onsite interview. Getting a meaningful and cinematic shot should come first. If you do not use a studio-quality microphone that comes with directional controls, you'll likely have distorted audio. You might want to go for a unidirectional stereo channel if you want boom movements to be undetectable.

When a cheap, low-quality microphone is moving, you'll hear the unsteadiness in your recording, leading to distorted audio. Recording audio in an echo chamber or an overly large room can also result in distorted audio.

#### 2\. Touching the Mic While Recording

If you hand the microphone to someone who does not know how to use it, they might hold it too loosely or close. Microphones feature sensitive parts that should not be dropped, shaken, or breathed on. When you are interviewing people unfamiliar with industry standards, you should hold the microphone, not the person you are interviewing. The mic is not within the range of 6" to 12 " away from the speaker, this could lead to distorted audio.

#### 3\. Using the Wrong Mic

A reliable mic comes with audio controls and captures room tone and timbre. It should be portable, compact, and have a wind sleeve. In outdoor situations where ADR is not an option, you might want to use a wind sleeve.

Podcast showrunners and content creators often use Blue Yeti mics connected to a soundboard. While these are cheaper options, they can cause distorted audio. Content creators who are not stationary should purchase a lavalier, and wireless is a more high-end and expensive option.

#### 4\. Positioning Your Microphones Incorrectly

You have to be careful if you'll be mounting a mic on your DSLR. Filming events with a one-mic setup is a promise to record everything you hear again. You'll inevitably film some moments at a distance and leave the audio compromised to distortion.

#### 5\. Faulty Equipment

Your equipment can fail in different ways. For instance, your effects processor can fail, meaning that you won't hear any sound passing through it. It can also fail, and you end up hearing a distorted sound passing out of the processor. Essentially, this might or might not be linked to the component's capability of handling the signal as much as the busted internals result.

## How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods

You can fix distorted audio using various methods. They include:

### Method 1: How To Fix Distorted Audio in Audacity

Audacity is the bread and butter for individuals who adore a crisp audio quality. Audacity helps users finetune various attributes of their recordings.

If the audio is still distorted, apply the filter again. Don't overdo the process numerous times to ensure your audio is not degraded, making the voice sound robotic and tinny.

Now, use compression to your advantage. If compression confuses you, think of it as a tool that adjusts your audio for the listener's benefit. Compression not only quiets the background minutiae that creeps into your recording, but it also boosts your voice and gives it a full, captivating resonance.

1. To start the compression process, select your audio track, press CTRL + A, click "Effect" and then click "Compressor."

![compress your audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-4.png)
