Bluezone Corporation specializes in bundles of sounds – there are typically several dozen sound effects in every single option that they have available on their website. Their sample sounds are all royalty-free, so you never have to worry about dealing with a copyright issue on anything that you make.

Every one of their horror sound effects on their site is recorded in 24 bit / 96 kHz, which makes inserting it into any production seamless and simple. The quality will be just as good (and sometimes, even better!) than what you’d be able to do on your own.
