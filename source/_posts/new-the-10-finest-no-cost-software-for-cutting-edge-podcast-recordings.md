### 10\. [ecamm Call Recorder for Skype](https://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/)

Zencastr separates tracks per guest which prevents quality drop-offs throughout the recording.

All interviews you record with Zencastr are edited automatically, so you don’t have to spend time adjusting the file’s audio levels.

This online platform simplifies the process of creating a podcast by offering automatic audio editing services. You just have to upload the files you would like to edit and the Alitu is going to improve their quality.

In addition, you can create a solo recording from the app, and post them on Podbean, Libsyn, Blubrry and other podcast hosting platforms. Even so, Alitu’s automatic audio editing features are not powerful enough to compete with more advanced and more affordable podcast recording software products. The app’s selection of [audio filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and plugins is also quite limited, especially when its price is considered.

**Pros**

Furthermore, you’ll be able to collaborate with other members of your team through the cloud or share your work via the [Avid Link](https://www.avid.com/products/avid-link) app. The audio recording features ProTools offers can be overwhelming for newcomers to the world of podcasts, so if you don’t have previous audio recording experience it is better to opt for a less demanding podcast recording software.

**Pros**

* Efficient call scheduling tools
* The number of calls you can make with Ringr isn’t limited

**Pros**

* Lets its users export recordings as audio and video files
* Great for conducting interviews through Skype
