## Audio Synchronization Techniques for Mac Users: Bringing Melodies to GIFs

# How to Add Music/ Audio to a GIF on Mac?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

When you are sending a GIF to your friends or uploading it on social media, you are actually expressing your emotions through it. But would it be better if you could music to your GIF?

GIF or Graphics Interchange Format is an image format that doesn’t support music. It’s because it cannot store audio files and just videos are compatible with a music file. So, does it mean you cannot add music to GIF?

Well, you can. If you **convert the GIF to a video file, you can add music to your GIF**. This is how some GIF posts on social media have audio. Adding music to your GIF will give it more spunk and will make them more entertaining and funnier.

In case you are wondering how to add music to your GIF files, here are a few ways you can try out.

## 1. Kawping

Do you want a cross-platform GIF maker that will help in adding music to your GIF? Kawping might just be the right choice for you. As already discussed, you can only add music to videos and GIF is a kind of image that cannot store audio files. However, with Kawping you can save the GIF in an MP4 format when you import the GIF.

The platform offers useful features that you can use to edit your GIF files. Here are the steps you need to follow to add music to the GIF file with Kawping.

• Open the Kawping official site and click on ‘Start Editing’ to insert the audio.

![kawping start editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/kawping-start-editing.jpg)

• Now, upload the GIF and edit it as you like such as adjusting the aspect ratio, adding animation effects, rotating GIF, etc.

![adjusting the aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/adjusting-the-aspect-ratio.jpg)

• Select the ‘Audio’ tab present above the menu and upload the audio file you would like to add. You can trim it to adjust the starting and the endpoint with the GIF’s length. You can also use a loop tool for adjusting the GIF length.
