## Adobe Audition

![adobe audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-video-mixer-1.jpg)

**Compatibility:**Mac and Windows

This is a next-level audio video mixer that we find to be an excellent option for mixing, recording, editing, and restoring files. This mixing software allows you easily record music or podcast for various platforms. In addition, it offers a sharing feature that will enable you to share directly from the platform. Adobe Audition provides two mixing modes: the waveform view and the multitrack view. While the Waveform view is ideal for stereo editing, the multitrack view allows users to edit tracks on a timeline. Luckily Audition enables you to switch between both views whenever you want, so you don’t have to choose one.

One of the impressive features that make Adobe Audition one of the best audio video mixers in 2022 is the ability to remove silence from inactive parts in the audio file. While doing this, you don’t have to lose sync in the file. As a result, it is ideal for podcasts and interview audios. It also features a loudness radar that allows you to analyze submix, single tracks, full mix, and many more according to several broadcast requirements.

Another nice feature we found impressive with Audition is the DeReverb tool that allows you to eliminate or remove reverberations from the audio file. IT efficiently handles short delays and spacious reverbs in your video and audio files. The sound remover tool is another impressive tool that allows you to remove car alarms, errant bumps, paper shuffling, and other unnecessary sounds from your audio and video file. You also gain access to the music remix tool that allows you to cut new versions of songs without necessarily sending them to the remixer.

You can efficiently adjust the song’s target duration to help you get the perfect fit. You can also customize the splices or favor rhythm elements to ensure the beats remain locked when necessary. All the functions available on Adobe Audition are useful for your audio and video mixes.

 Pros

* Strong sound removal, audio restoration, and noise reduction tools
* 100BG cloud storage available for all users
* You can access content and tutorials on how to use the software in the Adobe community
* Various visualization tools
* New loudness meter for streaming services

 Cons

* It doesn’t offer MIDI support

## EaseUS Video Mixer

![easeus video mixer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-video-mixer-2.jpg)

**Compatibility:**Windows

Another excellent audio video mixer you can consider that makes out the list is the EaseUS Video Mixer. Its features go beyond the video editing features and extend to audio-video mixing. It is a mixing software perfect for trimming video clips without limiting the length you can upload.

EaseUS offers a paid plan to access varying advanced filters and effects for your audio and video files. You can also import your files from various storage devices for efficient mixing and editing. The video editing software has a toolbar that gives you direct access to the mixing software. You can split, merge and mix video files as you want. This video mixing software also allows users to speed up or reduce their video speed.

Amongst its unique features is the voiceover feature. A record voiceover button allows you to add a custom voice to your video when you click it. It will include the recording in the video to help you understand how it flows with the video during the preview.
