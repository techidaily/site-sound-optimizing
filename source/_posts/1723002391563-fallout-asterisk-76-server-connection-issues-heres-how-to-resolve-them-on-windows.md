 Winsock is an application in Windows that handles the data on the computer that programs use for Internet access. So when you can’t connect Fallout 76 to its server, you can give Winsock a try.

Here is how to reset Winsock data:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and type **cmd** . Then right-click Command Prompt when it comes up as a result and select **Run as administrator** .
