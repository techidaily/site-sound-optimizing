Transcribing the audio and video recordings of interviews and meetings can help you to understand better the data you collected. Even if you are creating video content, a transcription can assist you in increasing its visibility on search engines. Transcribing a recording of any kind can make it easier to organize and archive the information the recording contains, and it enables you to have easy access to this data whenever you need it.
