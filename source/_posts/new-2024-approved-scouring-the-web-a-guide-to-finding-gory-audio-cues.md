#### 2 Remove audio from QuickTime MOV files

 Double click the target MOV video file in the timeline to highlight it. Then right click the video file and select "Audio Detach" option. The program will automatically separate the existing audio track from the original video file. You will find the separated audio track will appear in the Audio track. To remove the audio from MOV video, right click the audio track and choose "Delete". If you want to keep the audio file in the video, you can click "Mute" and the video audio will not appear in the video.

 Tip: This video editing tool also enables you to easily add your own sound track. To do this, just import the audio file as step 1 and then drag and drop it to the audio timeline. If the audio needs editing, double click it to adjust the volume, speed, pitch or add fade in/out effect in the pop up window.

#### 3 Export or save the new files

 Click the "Play" button in the right preview window to see the result. If you're satisfied, hit "Export" and you'll go to the export window. As you see, this program offers four output ways. In the "Format" tab, you can save the new work in all popular formats such as AVI, MP4, MOV, FLV and much more. You can also convert your video to a YouTube compatible format for online sharing in the "YouTube" tab and immediately upload it. Or burn a DVD disk in minutes to watch it on your home cinema.
