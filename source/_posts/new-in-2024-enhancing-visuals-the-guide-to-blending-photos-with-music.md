You have created a video with amazing transitions, titles, slides etc. but, the action in the video still missing? If yes, then you need to focus on the sound effects. MP3 cat sound effects are best to make your video more effective and attractive as well.

Audio is vital as it connects audiences. Further, the audio raises the entertainment value, elicits emotions, and set the mood. When used correctly, dialogue, audio effects, music, or even silence can drastically improve your movie.

An excellent audio effect can make or break your video. There can also be challenges to finding good sources for sound effects. There are many websites offering royalty-free sound effects which can be easily downloaded.

Let's look at where you can find cat sound effects in the mp3 format.

## Part 1 Websites That Offer Free Sound Effects

Several websites provide free cat sound effects which can be downloaded quickly. Each website has a diverse range of genres, styles, and sounds to choose from.

There are two ways you can go about this. One is by using free sound effects and the other using paid software. Remember, the type of licensure limits free sound effects.

![cat sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/cat-sound-effect.png)

Here are a few options for getting free cat sound effects:

### Adobe Audition Sound Effects

Sound effects in Adobe Audition add sophisticated richness to your audio compositions. You can choose from numerous free cat sound effects for everything where soundtracks are essential.

It allows you to add new sounds, emotions, and a dash of humor to your projects. Like adding a cat sound effect to your video!

### FreeSound

This website is a database of over 400,000 sound effects available for free download. With an old school website and easy navigation layout.

Remember, not all their sound effects can be used commercially. A few nonscript names, making it challenging to find the right sound.

### SoundBible

It is an easy-to-use program for sound effects. You can begin downloading the royalty-free audio effect clips users see as soon as it arrives at the site's top page. Every clip's license is prominently illustrated next to it, and there are thousands of them.

You can request a sound from the community if you can't locate it on SoundBible, a fantastic feature. The only criticism is that browsing for audio is a little cumbersome, and the site design needs a little patience for navigating.

Aside from that, this is a fantastic site, and the community that promotes it deserves recognition.

### YouTube

It offers creators an audio library for cat sound effects and other effects too. They are available at the Creator Studio. Once you enter the creator studio, select "Other Features" to find the audio library.

You can find many royalty-free sound effects and music. The sound effects tab allows users to sort by "most popular" and featured music.

Alternatively, you can filter using "Category" and sort through to find the cat sound effects.

Let's look at a few options to create the cat sound effects!

![cat sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/cat-sound.png)

### Option 1: YouTube

You can download a Cat Sound Effect from the YouTube search bar. In order to download the video, you can copy the link and use a YouTube specific video downloading website online.

This website allows users to select the format of the output file. With this, it has never been easier to download videos for either personal views or to convert to audio.

It's easy to convert a video to an audio file. There are online websites that allow users to convert cat sound effect videos into an mp3 file.

Another way to level up the audio file’s quality is by choosing the highest bitrate. Bitrates from audio can be anywhere from 96 bitrates to 320 bitrates.

Convert the file with a higher bitrate for better quality. Then embed the audio for its intended use.

### Option 2: Wondershare Filmora

The importance of music and atmospheric sounds is often underrated in social media videos. A good soundtrack can drastically increase the overall quality of a video since barely audible dialogues or background noises distract a viewer. Even adding simple effects like fade in or fade out can make a huge difference in how well a video is accepted by your friends on social media. If you would like to learn how to fade audio in your videos, you're at the right place, because in this article we are going to show you how to fade in or fade out an audio clip.

## Fading Audio in Adobe Rush

[Adobe Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html) app that was released a short while ago doesn't seem to be living up to the high standard we can commonly expect from Adobe's products. The app doesn't feature fade in/out options and its audio editing capabilities are limited. The only way you can fade audio with Adobe Rush is to open the project in Adobe Premiere Pro CC, but in order to be able to do so, you have to be subscribed to the Adobe's Creative Cloud.

Wondershare[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), on the other hand, offers all tools you're going to need to produce a YouTube video including the fade in and fade out audio effects at a more affordable price. Here's how you can fade audio in Filmora.

## Fading Audio in Wondershare Filmora

#### 1\. Import video and audio files into Filmora

Most video clips contain an audio track, but in some cases, you might want to remove the clip's original audio and replace it with music, narration, dialogue or atmospheric sounds you choose. You can import an audio file into Filmora by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and selecting the Import Media Files option.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-media-panel.JPG)

Alternatively, you can just drag and drop an audio file from the folder to the Media Panel. Filmora also features a rich library of royalty-free music you can use to select a soundtrack for your video. Drag and drop the video or audio file into the timeline from the Media Panel.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-audio-track.JPG)

#### 2\. Fading audio in Filmora

**Method 1: With Audio panel**

Clicking on the Edit button, located at the end of the software's toolbar will grant you the access to the software's audio panel where you can easily adjust the volume of the clip, select one of Equalizer presets or change the Pitch of the audio file.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-9-audio-panel.JPG)

Fade in and Fade out sliders are located at the top of the Audio panel and you can drag the handle on the slider or you can insert new Fade in or Fade out values manually in the boxes next to the sliders. You can click play and decide if you like the effect you created before you click OK to confirm the changes.

**Method 2: Directly from Timeline**

In case you want to fade an audio quickly you can do so directly from the timeline. Just click on the handle at the beginning or the end of the audio file and then drag it to adjust the duration of the effect. Both of Fade in or Fade out handles can be easily moved directly on the timeline, even if you set their values from the Audio Panel.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fading-audio-in-filmora-9-timeline.jpg)

Filmora features a lot of sound effects, like the Phone Ring, Explosion or Car Horn that can be combined with the Fade in or Fade out effect to create a better soundtrack for your video. When ready, click on the Export button and proceed to choose the video's resolution, file format or export destination. The software also lets you export MP3 files, which enables you to save all the changes you make while editing an audio file.

#### Conclusion

Even though Adobe Rush is an app aimed at YouTubers and social media video creators, fading in or out of an audio is still not an option. On the other hand, fading an audio in Filmora is a quick and simple process. Gradually introducing a new music theme or slowly fading the sound as a scene ends can make a social media video sound more professional, and it can help content creators to transition from one scene to the other more smoothly. Do you use Fade in or Fade out effects in your videos often? Leave a comment below and share your experiences with us.

## Fading Audio in Wondershare Filmora

#### 1\. Import video and audio files into Filmora

Most video clips contain an audio track, but in some cases, you might want to remove the clip's original audio and replace it with music, narration, dialogue or atmospheric sounds you choose. You can import an audio file into Filmora by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and selecting the Import Media Files option.

Alternatively, you can just drag and drop an audio file from the folder to the Media Panel. Filmora also features a rich library of royalty-free music you can use to select a soundtrack for your video. Drag and drop the video or audio file into the timeline from the Media Panel.

#### 2\. Fading audio in Filmora

**Method 1: With Audio panel**

Clicking on the Edit button, located at the end of the software's toolbar will grant you the access to the software's audio panel where you can easily adjust the volume of the clip, select one of Equalizer presets or change the Pitch of the audio file.

Fade in and Fade out sliders are located at the top of the Audio panel and you can drag the handle on the slider or you can insert new Fade in or Fade out values manually in the boxes next to the sliders. You can click play and decide if you like the effect you created before you click OK to confirm the changes.

**Method 2: Directly from Timeline**

In case you want to fade an audio quickly you can do so directly from the timeline. Just click on the handle at the beginning or the end of the audio file and then drag it to adjust the duration of the effect. Both of Fade in or Fade out handles can be easily moved directly on the timeline, even if you set their values from the Audio Panel.

Filmora features a lot of sound effects, like the Phone Ring, Explosion or Car Horn that can be combined with the Fade in or Fade out effect to create a better soundtrack for your video. When ready, click on the Export button and proceed to choose the video's resolution, file format or export destination. The software also lets you export MP3 files, which enables you to save all the changes you make while editing an audio file.

#### Conclusion

Even though Adobe Rush is an app aimed at YouTubers and social media video creators, fading in or out of an audio is still not an option. On the other hand, fading an audio in Filmora is a quick and simple process. Gradually introducing a new music theme or slowly fading the sound as a scene ends can make a social media video sound more professional, and it can help content creators to transition from one scene to the other more smoothly. Do you use Fade in or Fade out effects in your videos often? Leave a comment below and share your experiences with us.
