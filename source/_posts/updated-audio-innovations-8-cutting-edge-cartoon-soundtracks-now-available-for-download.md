Call recording features help you in numerous ways such as conducting remote interviews, keeping track of verbal agreements, and recording important meetings for later reference. A myriad of applications are available on iPhone and android.

Since most voice recording applications are expensive, Google voice turns out to be one of the best apps to record calls.

![Google voice recorder logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/google-voice-recording-1.jpg)

## What Is Google Voice?

The Google voice recording app is available on Android and iOS app stores and enables users to record calls, send text messages, customize voicemails, and save call recording transcripts.
