## Part 2: How to Record Sounds Playing on Your Computer Using Audacity On Windows?

Unlike Mac, Windows makes it simple to capture audio from a movie or media file running on your desktop. There seem to be two primary methods for accomplishing audacity record desktop audio in this way:

**1\. Use MME as the Audio Host**

**Step 1:** To use MME as your audio host, go to **Tracks** in the **Add New** tab in **Stereo Track** and create a new file.

![record playing sound with audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-playing-computer-sound-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2:** Change the **Audio Host** (to the left of **Recording Device**) to **MME**—this is the standard setting, so you might not have to change anything.

![change audio host in audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-audio-host-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** Choose desired option from the **Recording Device** dropdown menu. Based on your configuration, this might be referred to as **Wave Out** or **Loopback**. When you're uncertain, try it out.

![choose audio recording device in audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-recording-device-audacity.jpg)

**Step 4:** To record your audio source, click **Record**, then play it back.

**2\. Use WASAPI as the Audio Host**

WASAPI provides higher-resolution digital recordings. If capturing audio from an external monitor, it's also a good idea to utilize it.

**Step 1:** Convert the **Audio Host** from **MME** to **Windows WASAPI** after creating a fresh **Stereo Track**.

![  audacity change host ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-use-windows-wasapi-host.jpg)

**Step 2:** Switch the **Recording Device** to **Speaker (loopback).** To display the entire label, you might have to slide the toolbar's knobs outwards. Begin recording by pressing the **red dot** and then listen to the audio source. **Audacity** will capture the audio even if your PC is muted.

## Part 4: How to Set up Audacity to Record as Schedule?

A streaming video recorder or cassette can be used to arrange a recording. All of those are identical to Time Recordings in that they are used to schedule recording. The Timer record configuration dialog box may be used to set the beginning and finish of the recording. This is how you do it:

**Step 1:** By definition, the recording's **Start Date and Time** are set to the present time. It will begin recording on the present day and hour by default when you don't alter it. There is no default setting for the **End Date and Time**. You must either choose a date and time to determine the end time.

![audacity schedule recording ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-set-start-end-schedule.jpg)

**Step 2:** There is a **Checkbox** to **Save** the work immediately. By **Ticking** the option, you may choose the path or **Folder** where the file will be saved when the recording is finished.
