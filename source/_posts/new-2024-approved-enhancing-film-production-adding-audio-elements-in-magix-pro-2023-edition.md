 Having a perfect soundtrack to your videos is as important as having a perfectly captured footage, because the music and sounds you add to your videos, set the atmosphere of the video. Choosing the right music and atmospheric sounds to match the action taking place in the video is an important task that shouldn't be taken lightly since the video's reception by the audience depends on it. Failing to lip-sync or to add a knocking sound when someone is entering the room will reduce the realism of your film and break the illusion you tried so hard to create.

 Let's have a look at how you can add and remove audio files to video using Magix Movie Edit Pro video editing software.

## How to add audio to video in Magix Movie Edit Pro

 Before deciding to remove the audio file that was recorded together with the video clip, make sure that you already have sounds and music that will replace it. Having the audio recordings that match your video perfectly is of utmost importance because if you add files that don't match the video the final result will be barely watchable.

#### 1.Import the video clip and separate the video and audio

![magix-size-position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-ungroup.JPG)

 All video clips also contain an audio file, that isn't displayed on the Magix Movie Edit Pro's timeline until the two files are separated. In order to separate the audio and video file, you need to select the video file you placed on the timeline, by dragging it from the 'Import' tab and dropping it on the video track and then click on the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's timeline.

#### 2.Remove and replace the files on the audio track

 After clicking on the 'Ungroup' icon, you will be able to see an audio file on the editor's audio track. If you would like to remove it from the project entirely, select the audio file and click on the 'Delete' button on your keyboard. However, if you would like to keep parts of the original audio track, select the file, place the playhead at the position in the file where you would like to make the cut and then click on the 'Split objects' icon on the toolbar. Repeat the same action at the position where you would like the sound file to end.

 Adding new audio files to your project is simple, because all you need to do is head over to the 'Import' tab, locate the files you want to use in your video on your hard-drive and drag and drop them onto the audio track. Cut out the parts of the audio file you don't want to use by clicking on the ''Split objects' icon and make sure that the length of the audio matches the length of the video.

#### 3.Edit the audio files

![magix-size-position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-audio-effects.JPG)

 Magix Movie Edit Pro offers a large number of audio effects that can help you create a better soundtrack for your video. Click on the 'Effects' tab and slide down to the 'Audio Effects' section where you can adjust the volume, clean the background noises in the audio or apply some of many audio effects located under the 'Audio Effects' option. Additional audio effects can be purchased at the Magix Movie Edit Pro's store, but some of the effects can be pricey for consumer-level video editors.

 If you would like to merge the freshly created audio file with the video file after you applied all the audio effects you wanted, simply click on the 'Group' icon, located next to the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's toolbar.

## Alternative Way of Adding Audio to a Video

 Even though adding audio files to videos isn't such a complicated process in Magix Movie Edit Pro, you might still consider using a video editing software that provides more options for audio editing. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will enable you to split, trim, add or remove audio files from your project in just a few simple steps. The software also gives you access to numerous royalty free music tracks that can be used in videos created with Filmora. Producing great visual content with Filmora video editing software is a simple process that can be completed in a short period of time, due to the abundance of the editing tools that make the editing process fast and easy.

So, whether you want to knock together an excelling MP3 mix or you’re looking to make impressive music, check out the list below for the ideal MP3 music mixer for you.

1. [How to Mix Audio Video Tracks with Wondershare Filmora](#part6-1)

## Audacity

![audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mp3-mixer-mac-1.jpg)

The first free MP3 music mixer for Mac that we have to consider is Audacity. Audacity is hard to miss because of how easy it is to use. Therefore, many people tend to recommend this software. Audacity is an open-sourced MP3 music mixer that’s entirely free to use. It has a straightforward and interactive user interface that supports the most popular file types, including MP3, WAV, OGG, MIDI, and many more.

With Audacity, you can record right in the app or edit existing files as you miss. It also comes with many effects that you can utilize to improve your MP3 file. Another unique tool on Audacity is the spectrogram that allows you to analyze the audio frequencies. Audacity supports up to 32-bit audio files making it a powerful MP3 music mixer for Mac users.

This MP3 music mixer is ideal for beginners as its features are easy to navigate. However, this doesn’t mean that professional DJs and sound producers cannot also utilize this audio mixer. You can record audio to add to your MP3 using a mixer or a live microphone. It also lets you download digital recordings from social media platforms like YouTube. This free MP3 music mixer for Mac is a great option to explore.

 Pros

* It offers a spectrogram view to visualize frequencies
* It offers effects like Audio unity, which is specifically for Mac only
* Allows you to delete, cut, and merge clips
* It is entirely free to use
* Its keyboard shortcuts allow for a smooth workflow

 Cons

* Crashes tend to happen
* It doesn’t support non-destructive editing

## WavePad

![wavepad](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mp3-mixer-mac-2.jpg)

This is another impressive Mac MP3 music mixer you can use for free if you’re doing non-commercial mixing. WavePad is remarkable because it supports many file types, so there’s no need to convert your MP3 to another format before mixing on WavePad. It also supports users working on multiple files simultaneously. This means you can process thousands of files at the same time while editing a file. In addition, WavePad offers a vast range of effects and supports audio bookmarking, which you would find very useful.

Other features these mixer offers are voice manipulation and text-to-speech functions. It is quite easy to use, making it an excellent option for beginners. Some of the effects people seem to love on this MP3 music mixer is the compression, noise removal, reverb, and many more. There’s also the analysis tool that advanced users can utilize to mix and edit their MP3 files.

With WavePad, speed and pitch changes are entirely possible. It also supports audio scrubbing, which is very handy. However, this file doesn’t support multi-tracking. Therefore, users can edit stereo or mono audio files on the software. Although its multi-window interface can take a while to get used to, this Mac MP3 music mixer is worth a try.

 Pros

* It is free for non-commercial use
* It comes with many impressive features
* Allows batch processing by users
* Supports common file types

 Cons

* The interface can take some time to get used to

## Ocenaudio

![ocenaudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mp3-mixer-mac-3.jpg)

Another free cross-platform MP3 music mixer is another excellent option for your Mac devices. It is a great option if you’re looking for a budget-friendly option to edit and mix your MP3 files. This software supports many file types like MP3, WMA, FLAC, and many more. It also supports video formats if you also want to edit video files.

This MP3 music mixer comes with a clean and colorful user interface; it is easy to use and fast for mixing your MP3 files. WavePad has many effects like EQ, compression, and reverb, allowing you to tweak your MP3 files while mixing your music files. Unlike other MP3 mixers that are destructive when you are trying to edit the MP3 music file, this is not the case with Ocenaudio. With this software, you can tweak the parameters of the effect and hear the changes immediately.

Ocenaudio also supports VST; you can add your plugins when editing MP3 files. In addition, you can record audio straight in the software and use the spectrogram feature to visualize frequencies for advanced users. Professional music mixers would find this feature to be very welcoming.

Although it doesn’t support multi-track sessions, which means you can’t record several instruments and mix them, it is an excellent option for your mono file mixing. It is also quite simple to use compared to other basic MP3 music mixers for Mac.

 Pros

* It offers the spectrogram feature
* It is free to use
* Users can install their plugins
* Ocenaudio offers non-destructive music editing

 Cons

* It doesn’t support multi-track sessions

The Filmora Video Editor is easy to use and delivers various features superior to those provided by other video editors. Because of this, it is considered one of the best audio editors to answer **how to** **remove static from audio** and video.

Here is **how to remove static noise from audio** with Filmora.

Step1 Upload Files

Open Wondershare Filmora and load your video into the timeline window. You can get a video preview, cut it up, and remove the bits you don't want to preserve.

Step2 Edit Audio

Select "Edit Audio" by using the context menu after right-clicking the movie in the timeline. You will see four options: silence detection, modify audio, disconnect audio, and mute. Choose the "Audio" option from the drop-down menu if you want to separate the audio from the video.

Step3 Remove Background Static

Double-click on the audio track to eliminate the background noise directly, and pick "normal denoise" from the Edit Panel. You may also double-click the video clip in the timeline to reach the Editing panel without first separating the audio from the video. Once there, you can edit the audio and eliminate the noise by clicking on the Audio tab in the Editing panel.

## Part 3: How to Record Noise-Free Audio?

So, that was **how to remove static sound from audio**. But what if you record noise-free audio instead?

If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.

If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn't there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.

Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.

Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.

One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists. If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.

## Conclusion

Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem? Video quality is vital, but audio noise can quickly damage your film. However, **removing static sound from audio** may be a pain in the neck. In addition, capturing clear audio may be challenging, particularly in areas with a lot of background noise.

Now you have an audio file with less or no noise and want to learn **how to remove static noise from audio**. With the above suggestions, I hope you'll find eliminating background noise from the video easy. If you want to be more creative in removing **static noise from audio**, try the Filmora video editor to give your mind a boost.
