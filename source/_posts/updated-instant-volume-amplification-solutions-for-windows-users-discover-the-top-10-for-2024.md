* The "Adjust Audio" trait helps make needed adjustments to the audio. There are multiple adjustment sliders for pitch and volume.
* The "Audio Denoise" feature helps you steer clear of background noise coming out of your audio clips. This trait has changed the narrative of all audio recorders in the world.
* The Audio Equalizer can also be customized in seconds that offers the user a variety of options. Moreover, you can fade the audio in and out by using the slider effortlessly.
