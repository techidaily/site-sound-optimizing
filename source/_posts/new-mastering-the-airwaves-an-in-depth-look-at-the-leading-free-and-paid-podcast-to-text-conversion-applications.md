## Part 1: How to Add Background Music to Video

In the content below, we will show you the detailed steps of adding background music or sound effect with [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Besides adding music, users can also cut and edit audio easily at the same time.

### **Step 1**: Import your original videos

Click the "Import" option to load the video files from your computer hard disk to the User's album. Alternatively, simply drag and drop these videos from your computer to the primary window. All the added video clips will be displayed in the left media pane. Note that you can add still images files if needed.

![add music to youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-9.jpg)

### **Step 2**: Add background music to the video

Drag the imported video files from the album to the tracks on the Timeline one by one. Make sure that they are arranged according to the play order and without overlapping. Then drag and drop the music files to the track above the video track. Now you can trim it and adjust the position to fit for your video length. When you set the position, you can check the previewing window and fine-tune it in real-time.

One of the benefits of using background music with Filmora is that there is a royalty-free Audio library that provides different genres of background music and sound effects. So, if you don’t want to find and download music from websites, just check the Audio Library in Filmora. Click the music thumbnail in the Media pane, and then drag and drop it to the track in the timeline pane.

![add background music to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-9.jpg)

**Editing audio tips**: Double click the music file in the track to pop up the audio editing panel.

### **Step 2**: Add background music to the video

Drag the imported video files from the album to the tracks on the Timeline one by one. Make sure that they are arranged according to the play order and without overlapping. Then drag and drop the music files to the track above the video track. Now you can trim it and adjust the position to fit for your video length. When you set the position, you can check the previewing window and fine-tune it in real-time.

One of the benefits of using background music with Filmora is that there is a royalty-free Audio library that provides different genres of background music and sound effects. So, if you don’t want to find and download music from websites, just check the Audio Library in Filmora. Click the music thumbnail in the Media pane, and then drag and drop it to the track in the timeline pane.

 Finding a high quality, reliable MPA to MP3 converter is a necessity for many. Whether you want to change the format to fit a device or you want an MP3 for a specific, personal reason, you will need to find a good converter. Most likely, this is not something that you can handle on your own. You will need to make sure that you have a good option available to you that you know you can trust and that you know will work. Here, we will look at three available options. Not all will suit everyone’s needs, but they each work in their own way. Anyone looking into these converters should consider the three options below.

 There are many more options out there. A thing to remember, though, is that MPA is not a widely common or popular file. You might find some programs that do not include it at all. When on the search for programs that do, this can become frustrating. If you are choosing to purchase one, make sure that you see all of the compatible file types. You should not pay for a program if it cannot convert the files you have, obviously. All programs should list the compatible files on the website or you can contact the developers directly to ask.

 If you want to make this quick, however, above you have the best MPA to MP3 converter list. These three options will give you the quality, reliability, and usability that you want out of a converter, whether you use it once or regularly.
