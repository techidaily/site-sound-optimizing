# How to Recognize Songs on iPhone?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

You listen to a catchy song or a tune you have never heard before and want to add it to your iPhone playlist, but you do not know any relevant details of that song to look for it online. What is the title of the song? Who sang it?

Now you can get all these details by just making the in-built iPhone music recognition feature listen to the song. Read on to know how to do that.

* [**Part 1: How to Use the In-built Music Recognition on iPhone?**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: How to Use Siri to Identify Songs by Humming on iPhone?**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Best Apps for iPhone Music Recognition**](#part3)
* [**Part 4: How to Choose a Music Recognition App?**](#part4)

## How to Use the In-built Music Recognition on iPhone?

In November 2020, Apple released the iOS 14.2 update for their iPads and iPhones. One of the features of this update was that it included built-in music and song recognition button that makes it easier for the user to recognize any song playing around them.

You just need to add the iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center menu and simply press that button when you hear a song that you like. You will then get all the information related to that song; title, artist’s name, and album title.

Here is how you add the in-built iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center:

Note: Make sure that you have the latest version of the iOS installed on your iPhone as this feature is not available on older versions. To check the running version, go to Settings -> General -> About, and then you will see the software version.

Step 1 - Open Settings> Control Center, and then tap **More** to scroll down.

Step 2- Tap the “+” button that is next to “Music Recognition”, and the iPhone music recognition button is added to the Control Center

![add music recognition feature to control center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-recognition-to-control-center-ios.jpg)

It is very easy to access and use this music recognition feature. If you have an iPhone that uses facial ID recognition to unlock, then pull down the Control Center shade by swiping down from the top right corner of the phone and tap the music recognition button.

![using  music recognition feature in iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/using-music-recognition-to-identify-song.jpg)

If your iPhone has a home button, then swipe up to get into the Control Center menu and tap the music recognition button.

You will see the Music Recognition notification icon that shows which song is playing.

The iPhone will listen for around 10 to 15 seconds once you tap the button – and will attempt to identify the song in that time period.

This feature can recognize songs playing in your environment even when your headphones are plugged in.

1. **What’s the difference between the Shazam app and the in-built Shazam music recognition feature?**

iOS users who haven’t upgraded to the iOS 14.2 update will not be able to access the features

When the process is complete, you’ll see a “Music Recognition” notification banner showing you what song is playing. This notification appears along with all your other apps’ notifications in your notification center.

Your iPhone will only listen for 10 to 15 seconds after you tap the button. If it can’t identify a song in that period of time, you’ll see a notification saying a song wasn’t detected.

## Audacity Automation: Implementing Auto-Tune Effectively in Your Projects

You might be surprised to learn that audacity's many default audio effects do not include an autotune feature if you have ever had to correct a song's pitch or tuning. Not to worry!. GSnap is a free plugin that lets you use autotune (not to be confused with Auto-Tune) in audacity. On Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux computers, you can autotune and adjust the pitch of recorded files using GSnap.

This article will guide you to download the audacity autotune plugin to your computer and install it. Then you will be able to adjust the pitch of your sounds easily and tune them automatically without any hassle. This is a free download that can be installed in audacity to help you fine-tune your live vocal performance. During vocal pitch correction, it allows audacity to expand its functionality.

## **How Does Auto-tune Works?**

Negative feedback from listeners is a common occurrence for singers. They need to satisfy their audience by giving them their most perfect production numbers. Nevertheless, there are instances when they need the aid of a device to conceal their mistakes or avoid making them. So they lip-sync and autotune their prerecorded songs.

Singers and music producers are not the only ones to use autotune. The most common users are ordinary people who have made music creation a part of their lives. Then how does autotuning operate?

The pitch is raised to the nearest correct tone when a person sings with the key off (out-of-tune). Moreover, the distortion can mask the out-of-tune parts (especially the highest and lowest pitches) in the overall performance.

## **How To Add Autotune To Audacity Using GSnap?**

The autotune effect in audacity is enabled by the GSnap plugin (from GVST). This might be useful for correcting your pitch or creating a robotic voice. You can download it for free and install it on your computer.

You need to follow the steps to get a free autotune for audacity. Be sure to follow every step to avoid any issues.

### **Step 1**
