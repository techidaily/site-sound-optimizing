### 4\. Sound Editor: [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

**Adobe Audition** comes with a high price at $20/mo. However, users who demand the best will find the cost worth it for a license. It has the most extensive audio and music editing toolset, and it supports the widest range of formats.

A complete range of tutorials also supports adobe Audition to help you get the most from your investment. The fact it takes a while to work through the tutorials and get up to speed might be the only drawback.

## Section 3\. How to choose Music Editor for Mac users?

Choosing a music editor for Mac, including the ability to edit and output to MP3 and MP4 formats, depends entirely on your needs. If your needs are modest and limited features or functionality work for you, several free-to-use options will get the job done. If you need more robust functionality and professional quality, a pay program will offer more satisfying performance. Keep in mind the following questions when making your choice:

* How often do I need to edit music and audio?
* Do I need simple trim and edit features, or also audio effects?
* What formats are my source files, and what formats do I want to output to?
* What is my budget, and how can I balance performance and price?

With Filmora, you can edit music and audio files with ease. Besides basic cutting features, you can apply fade-in and fade-out effects, adjust the audio volume. What's more, you can remove the background noise in the audio to get a clear sound.

## Section 2\. Professional Quality Music Editors for Mac

Pay music editing programs for Mac offer a serious boost in performance and an increased number of supported formats and output options.

Two pay music and audio editors for Mac we recommend are:
