You just have to send a link to your guest and this web-based podcast recorder will capture the interview in lossless 16-bit 44.1k quality.

All interviews you record with Zencastr are edited automatically, so you don’t have to spend time adjusting the file’s audio levels.

In addition, you can create a solo recording from the app, and post them on Podbean, Libsyn, Blubrry and other podcast hosting platforms. Even so, Alitu’s automatic audio editing features are not powerful enough to compete with more advanced and more affordable podcast recording software products. The app’s selection of [audio filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and plugins is also quite limited, especially when its price is considered.

**Pros**

Furthermore, you’ll be able to collaborate with other members of your team through the cloud or share your work via the [Avid Link](https://www.avid.com/products/avid-link) app. The audio recording features ProTools offers can be overwhelming for newcomers to the world of podcasts, so if you don’t have previous audio recording experience it is better to opt for a less demanding podcast recording software.

**Pros**

* Enables podcasters to conduct remote interviews
* Efficient call scheduling tools
* The number of calls you can make with Ringr isn’t limited
* Quick download process
