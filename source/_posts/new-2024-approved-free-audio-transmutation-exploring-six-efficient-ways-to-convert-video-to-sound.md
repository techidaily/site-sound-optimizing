Music can improve a video montage by providing emotional context, elevating the atmosphere, and encouraging viewer engagement. There are many montage videos, such as supercuts, sports edits, comedy clips, and more. All these montages have their tone, style, and subject matter.

## How A Well-Picked Song Enhances Your Montage Video

If you have ever been to YouTube and searched for montage videos, then you must have noticed that they all have one thing in common. They have a great soundtrack.

The music is what makes the montage video so special. The right song can make your montage video go viral, while the wrong one can make it fail miserably.

Here are some tips to help you pick the right music for your next montage:

#### 1\. Choose music that matches the mood of your video

Many people make the mistake of choosing songs that don't fit their videos at all. For example, if you're making a movie about love and romance, it doesn't make sense to use a heavy metal song about death and destruction. If you do, then your viewers will find it hard to connect with your movie because they will be distracted by the mismatch between what they see and what they hear.

#### 2\. Pick songs that match the genre of your video

If you're making a romantic comedy movie, then try picking up some romantic pop songs instead of heavy metal ones or classical ones. This way, your viewers will know right away what type of movie they're watching and will be able to enjoy themselves more because they know what to expect from it visually and audibly.

#### 3\. The length of your montage video

If you have a long montage video (over 1 minute), you may want to use shorter songs (under 3 minutes) to fit seamlessly into each other without any awkward pauses or breaks in sound.

#### 4\. Keep in mind that there are two types of songs - instrumental and vocal

Vocal songs have lyrics that can be sung along while listening to them, whereas instrumental ones don't have any words but only music in them. It depends on what kind of effect you want to create in your audience's minds when they listen to it. For example, if you want people to feel happy about something or if it's about a celebration, then an instrumental one will work better than a vocal one because most people don't like singing along with instrumental songs since they don't know what the actual lyrics are.

#### 5\. Think about the emotions you want to convey

The most important thing when choosing a song is that it matches the emotion of your montage video. For example, if you want to express joyfulness, then you should choose a happy song with a rhythm that can bring up people’s spirits; if you want to express sadness, then you should choose a sad song with an emotional melody; if you want to express anger or hatred, then use heavy metal music; if you want to express love, then use romantic music; etc.

These are some tips to consider when adding music to your montage videos. Music is an important part of a video montage. It's the second most important part after the video itself. A good song can make your montage more enjoyable and memorable. The wrong one can ruin it completely.

## Part 3: Free Music Production Software Online

### 11\. [Soundation](https://soundation.com/)

Soundation is a platform that provides free music production software online only capabilities. The free version and three paid versions are offered. You can use this to build your tracks unless you have the resources to do so if you need a web-based music maker and editor.

If you pay, even after you have made your music, you can always cancel. Remember first to save them to your hard drive. If you need paid characteristics, pay for the monthly plan again through PayPal, and you have to use it for a month.

**Pros**

* Great SSL-modelled mixer
* You can use its devices as a plugin

**Cons**

* It works only online

It uses a cloud-based network to store all your music and files wherever you are. It is also confirmed that you will share music and tracks directly with YouTube, SoundCloud, and Facebook on its own publishing site. They have premium releases from Loopmasters and some fantastic online VSTs, for example, Heisenberg, Machiniste, Bassline, and Beatbox 8 & 9.

**Pros**

* No installation needed
* You can directly share it to your social media

### 13\. [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/)

Soundtrap is not only an online music studio but a training site for students and instructors. The STEAM Curriculum is an online learning resource that helps students to follow music and podcasts, incorporated into the Web app. As we mentioned earlier, in addition to the online Web App, you can also use it on different devices, share it with other users, and work in innovative projects for your music.

The interface is simple, easy to use, and easy to understand. It is simply an instrument for innovation; you don't have to learn how to apply VST or any other technical elements to music creation. You can also record your MIDI instruments directly from your machine or device's mic.

**Pros**

* It provides a great platform for teachers to teach their students
* It is very easy to use

**Cons**

* It only has a limited number of plugins
* It cannot be used professionally

## Conclusion

If you make music on a computer, the most important resource in your artistic arsenal is your DAW; in your home recording system, you 're probably going to have the MIDI keyboard, audio interface, studio monitor speakers, and maybe a microphone or two. But your program is at the core of it all. Not everyone can afford expensive DAWs, but one must not worry as free music production software are present to aid us.

It is important to have a DAW with which you are pleased and, perhaps more importantly, a DAW, which allows you to turn your ideas into music as quickly and painlessly as possible. So make sure you choose the best one for you according to your needs. Hopefully, this guide will aid you!
