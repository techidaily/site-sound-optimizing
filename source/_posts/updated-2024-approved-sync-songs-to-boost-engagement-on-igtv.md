## Bonus: Video Volume Booster Software

If you are looking for a dedicated software to boost the volume of your videos, we recommend Wondershare Filmora. A standalone software is useful when you have to boost the volume of multiple large video files. Uploading large video files online is a time-consuming as well as a heavy data-consumption process.

With Filmora, you can not only adjust the volume but also optimize various parameters of the audio in a video file. Filmora is a professional video editor and you can ever capture video through webcam as well as capture your screen video with system sound and mic audio. You can add video effects as well as audio effects during the editing phase and export the edited video files in different file formats.

Here are the steps to boost volume in Filmora.

Step 1: Download and install Filmora on your computer. Open the software and click on New Project.
