### Step 2: Increase or Decrease Audio Speed

Ensure that the audio track is selected in the timeline. Click the **Speedometer** icon from the timeline toolbar at the upper section, hover mouse to the **Slow** option from the menu, and click your preferred value form the submenu to reduce the sound speed.

**Note:** Usually, the audio pitch wouldn't change as long as you pick the values anywhere between 0.5x and 5x. However, if you select any option beyond this range, you may experience variations in the pitch according the value you selected.

### Step 3: Set Custom Speed or Reverse the Audio

Click the **Speedometer** icon from above the timeline, and click **Custom Speed** from the menu. Use the slider to slow down (move to the left) or speed up (move to the right) the audio on the Custom Speed box. Alternatively, you can manually enter your preferred value in the available field for granular control. In addition, you can also check the **Reverse Speed** box to reverse the audio if need be.
