## **How To Make Your Voice Deeper Naturally?**

**1\. Listen to Yourself**

First of all, you have to think about what you have to work with. Record yourself talking with the app on your phone that records audio. If you do not listen carefully to your voice, you will not know what needs to be fixed.

Take a moment to listen to your voice. Because you're now hearing your voice from an external perspective, it might sound completely different from how you thought it would. You can't always avoid mistakes, but you can learn from them.

Take note of how you sound and accept that this is exactly how you sound. During this exercise, listen carefully as words come out of your mouth, study your pitch, and record your voice so you can review the recording later after you've completed your exercise.

**2\. Relax Your Muscles**

As a consequence of stress, bad posture, and injuries, our muscles are drowning in tension. Our entire lives involve the use of our bodies, which directly affects our muscles and adds a great deal of tension. There are four key areas of our body. If you want to make your voice deeper, then you have to release tension from these four key areas. They include the tongue, jaw, throat, and neck. All these organs play a key role in controlling your voice. So, if you are able to relieve stress from these organs and you are able to relax them, then you can easily make your voice deeper with a little practice.

**3\. Use Your Diaphram**

If you're wondering how to make your voice deeper, you shouldn't use your chest for breathing when we have a whole respiratory system to control. As a rule of thumb, the deeper your voice sounds, the deeper the air you inhale goes. You can direct the air to go just where you want it by adjusting the diaphragm.

As you breathe in, bring your nose to your mouth and push your chest backward while taking deep breaths from your nose. When you exhale, tell yourself your full name as you do so. When you speak, you may feel a vibration. It is now easier for you to produce a deeper voice effect since you have learned how to use your diaphragm.

In the world of professional singing, diaphragmatic breathing is one of the most popular techniques. With it, they can control their voice and position it precisely when they want, to produce deep, low-pitched cries (or even high-pitched cries). When you first start, you won't be able to do it naturally, but you'll be able to do it subconsciously with practice.

**4\. Practice Your Chest Voice**

The magic happens in your chest voice. You can make it sound stronger, deeper, and less nasal with a little control. These exercises will focus on deepening your voice since you're looking for ways to make your voice deeper.

Engage your throat first and then speak normally. You will sound lighter and less confident if you usually speak through your nose, which is not good for a deep voice.

Make a hissing sound while exhaling a deep diaphragmatic breath. Having your voice-controlled right within your lungs will allow you to open up your chest. It would help if you started talking now. You will feel your voice flowing up and out of your mouth via your breath. This is the voice of your chest.

**5\. Hum Like You Mean It**

Humming warms up your voice, making it easier to control. In addition, it unleashes feelings of relaxation throughout your entire body, so your muscles can be relaxed. With Hum, you'll be able to lower your voice pitch, talk deeper, and even make your voice sound deeper in a video. Hold your breath with a deep humming for as long as possible. During this process, your vocal cords will be stretched, and stretched vocal cords always give a voice a deeper tone.

As you breathe in again, point your chin downwards toward your chest. Put your chin up and start humming. Speak now. You will feel intense and deep in your voice.

These are some of the natural ways to make your voice deeper. But the thing is, all of them need a lot of practice, and according to experts, one can also damage his vocal cords when practicing all these techniques. But as we told you earlier, there is an easier way of making your voice deeper which is discussed below.

## A Filmmaker's Guide to Blending Sound and Visuals with Magix Pro Software

# How to add Audio to Video in Magix Movie Edit Pro

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

 Having a perfect soundtrack to your videos is as important as having a perfectly captured footage, because the music and sounds you add to your videos, set the atmosphere of the video. Choosing the right music and atmospheric sounds to match the action taking place in the video is an important task that shouldn't be taken lightly since the video's reception by the audience depends on it. Failing to lip-sync or to add a knocking sound when someone is entering the room will reduce the realism of your film and break the illusion you tried so hard to create.

 Let's have a look at how you can add and remove audio files to video using Magix Movie Edit Pro video editing software.

## How to add audio to video in Magix Movie Edit Pro

 Before deciding to remove the audio file that was recorded together with the video clip, make sure that you already have sounds and music that will replace it. Having the audio recordings that match your video perfectly is of utmost importance because if you add files that don't match the video the final result will be barely watchable.

#### 1.Import the video clip and separate the video and audio

![magix-size-position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-ungroup.JPG)

 All video clips also contain an audio file, that isn't displayed on the Magix Movie Edit Pro's timeline until the two files are separated. In order to separate the audio and video file, you need to select the video file you placed on the timeline, by dragging it from the 'Import' tab and dropping it on the video track and then click on the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's timeline.

#### 2.Remove and replace the files on the audio track

 After clicking on the 'Ungroup' icon, you will be able to see an audio file on the editor's audio track. If you would like to remove it from the project entirely, select the audio file and click on the 'Delete' button on your keyboard. However, if you would like to keep parts of the original audio track, select the file, place the playhead at the position in the file where you would like to make the cut and then click on the 'Split objects' icon on the toolbar. Repeat the same action at the position where you would like the sound file to end.

 Adding new audio files to your project is simple, because all you need to do is head over to the 'Import' tab, locate the files you want to use in your video on your hard-drive and drag and drop them onto the audio track. Cut out the parts of the audio file you don't want to use by clicking on the ''Split objects' icon and make sure that the length of the audio matches the length of the video.

#### 3.Edit the audio files

![magix-size-position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-audio-effects.JPG)

 Magix Movie Edit Pro offers a large number of audio effects that can help you create a better soundtrack for your video. Click on the 'Effects' tab and slide down to the 'Audio Effects' section where you can adjust the volume, clean the background noises in the audio or apply some of many audio effects located under the 'Audio Effects' option. Additional audio effects can be purchased at the Magix Movie Edit Pro's store, but some of the effects can be pricey for consumer-level video editors.

 If you would like to merge the freshly created audio file with the video file after you applied all the audio effects you wanted, simply click on the 'Group' icon, located next to the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's toolbar.

## Alternative Way of Adding Audio to a Video

 Even though adding audio files to videos isn't such a complicated process in Magix Movie Edit Pro, you might still consider using a video editing software that provides more options for audio editing. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will enable you to split, trim, add or remove audio files from your project in just a few simple steps. The software also gives you access to numerous royalty free music tracks that can be used in videos created with Filmora. Producing great visual content with Filmora video editing software is a simple process that can be completed in a short period of time, due to the abundance of the editing tools that make the editing process fast and easy.

 Having a perfect soundtrack to your videos is as important as having a perfectly captured footage, because the music and sounds you add to your videos, set the atmosphere of the video. Choosing the right music and atmospheric sounds to match the action taking place in the video is an important task that shouldn't be taken lightly since the video's reception by the audience depends on it. Failing to lip-sync or to add a knocking sound when someone is entering the room will reduce the realism of your film and break the illusion you tried so hard to create.

 Let's have a look at how you can add and remove audio files to video using Magix Movie Edit Pro video editing software.

## How to add audio to video in Magix Movie Edit Pro

 Before deciding to remove the audio file that was recorded together with the video clip, make sure that you already have sounds and music that will replace it. Having the audio recordings that match your video perfectly is of utmost importance because if you add files that don't match the video the final result will be barely watchable.

#### 1.Import the video clip and separate the video and audio

 All video clips also contain an audio file, that isn't displayed on the Magix Movie Edit Pro's timeline until the two files are separated. In order to separate the audio and video file, you need to select the video file you placed on the timeline, by dragging it from the 'Import' tab and dropping it on the video track and then click on the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's timeline.

#### 2.Remove and replace the files on the audio track

 After clicking on the 'Ungroup' icon, you will be able to see an audio file on the editor's audio track. If you would like to remove it from the project entirely, select the audio file and click on the 'Delete' button on your keyboard. However, if you would like to keep parts of the original audio track, select the file, place the playhead at the position in the file where you would like to make the cut and then click on the 'Split objects' icon on the toolbar. Repeat the same action at the position where you would like the sound file to end.

 Adding new audio files to your project is simple, because all you need to do is head over to the 'Import' tab, locate the files you want to use in your video on your hard-drive and drag and drop them onto the audio track. Cut out the parts of the audio file you don't want to use by clicking on the ''Split objects' icon and make sure that the length of the audio matches the length of the video.

#### 3.Edit the audio files

 Magix Movie Edit Pro offers a large number of audio effects that can help you create a better soundtrack for your video. Click on the 'Effects' tab and slide down to the 'Audio Effects' section where you can adjust the volume, clean the background noises in the audio or apply some of many audio effects located under the 'Audio Effects' option. Additional audio effects can be purchased at the Magix Movie Edit Pro's store, but some of the effects can be pricey for consumer-level video editors.

 If you would like to merge the freshly created audio file with the video file after you applied all the audio effects you wanted, simply click on the 'Group' icon, located next to the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's toolbar.
