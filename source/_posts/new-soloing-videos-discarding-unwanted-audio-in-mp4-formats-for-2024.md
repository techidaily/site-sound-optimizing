## **Conclusion**

Echoes in your soundtracks can be so annoying. They affect the clarity of vocals and can make your audio or video seem unprofessional. While there are many ways you can remove echo from audio, we recommend Wondershare Filmora. The versatile video editor comes with a broad choice of features to help you edit your audio more accurately. You can remove echoes, wind, and more while maintaining the same quality of your audio. The software also allows you to continue editing your audio or video further as desired.
