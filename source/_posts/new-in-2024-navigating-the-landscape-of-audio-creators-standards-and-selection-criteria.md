It has been a little over fifteen years since Ben Hammersley coined the term podcast. During this time, radio and TV stations, as well as people from all walks of life, have embraced this new medium of spreading information through either audio or video files.

Even though podcasts often have the form of a talk show, the topics podcasters cover in their shows range from presenting the latest music releases to discussing political topics.

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you.

![Best Podcast Player App - Overcast ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/overcast-podcast-player.jpg)

Overcast was launched just five years ago, but today it is **recognized as one of the best podcast player apps for iPhones, iWatches, and iPads.** If you are looking for an app that will shorten the silences in podcasts, normalize the volume of the voices or enable you to adjust the playback speed of the audio files, then Overcast is probably one of your best options.

The app also provides **CarPlay support** and allows you to listen to your favorite podcasts even while you are on the road. However, Overcast contains ads, and you must purchase the Premium version of the app if you want to remove them.

### 10\. Castro

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241)

![Best Podcast Player App - Castro Podcast Player ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/castro-podcast-player.jpg)

Managing large numbers of episodes with Castro won’t take much more than a few moments of your time. Subscribe to a podcast you like, and all of the latest episodes will land in the New tab. You can then decide if you want to add them to the queue and listen to them while you are driving or on your iPhone.

The free version of the app doesn’t allow you to skip intros, enhance voices or reduce silence, and you must purchase Castro Plus to access these options. Before you decide to install Castro or Castro Plus on your device, you must make sure that the app is compatible with the version of iOS you have.

### 11\. Podbean

**Price:** Free but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id973361050), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.podbean.app.podcast&referrer=utm%5Fsource%3Dpodbean%5Fweb%26utm%5Fcampaign%3Dpb%5Flanding%5Fapp)

![Best Podcast Player App - Podbean Podcast Player ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/podbean-podcast-app-player.jpg)

With the selection of over 50 million episodes, Podbean is easily one of the most versatile podcast player apps on this list. You can search for podcasts based on the topic you are interested in, or browse through different categories, and use the name of the podcast, or the author’s name to find the episode you are looking for.

Podbean is equipped with an **audio recorder** that features a rich selection of audio effects and a versatile set of audio editing tools. Moreover, the app provides support for live audio streaming so you can create or listen to live broadcast directly from your Smartphone.

### 12\. Laughable

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:**[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/laughable/id1078473343), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laughable&hl=en%5FUS)

![Best Podcast Player App - Laughable Podcast Player ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/laughable-podcast-player-app.jpg)

Keeping in touch with the latest trends in the comedy world is going to become easy if you install Laughable on your device. The app hosts the world’s largest database of comedy artist profiles and enables you to discover and follow comedians effortlessly. Each time they release a new episode of their podcast or make a guest appearance, you’ll receive a notification, which enables you to follow their latest work.

Besides an impressive collection of comedy podcasts, Laughable also lets you browse through podcasts featuring celebrities like Jordan Peterson, Barak Obama or Oprah. The app is free for just ten days, afterward, you must upgrade to Laughable Insider if you want to have access to all the shows and episodes this podcast player has to offer.

## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.
