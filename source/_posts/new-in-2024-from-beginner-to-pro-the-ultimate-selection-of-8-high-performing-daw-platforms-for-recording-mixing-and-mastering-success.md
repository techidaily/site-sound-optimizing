### Steps to Use Auto Audio Sync Tool

This tool is best as it gives a perfect result when you try to match your audio files with your video files. For example, you might have a YouTube channel, and you record your audio from a Microphone, your video from a webcam camera, and your screen from your computer. The audio directly from the camera could be a little faint, resulting from the recording being farther from where you are. While the audio from the microphone would give you a high-quality audio.

![Sync Audio to Video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-3.jpg)

First, detach your audio file from your screen recording as the tool works with an audio file and a video file. Right-click on the audio file and click on detach audio to separate the audio file from the screen recording.

![Sync Audio to Video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-4.jpg)

Return the audio file and the screen recording to the normal position, which gives you three layers on the timeline.

![Sync Audio to Video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-5.jpg)

Next, select your audio and your video by making sure both footages are related to each other and then right-click and then tap the audio synchronization. This will sync the audio and the video together, and the echo will seize because the footage will perfectly match the audio.

## Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video

The first way that can help you sync audio and video is merging the two files. You can simply get the media from the folders and this allows you to sync a max of 16 audio files to single video.

* To proceed, press **Control** and **Command**\> key on Windows and Mac respectively. Now, pick out the two files that you want to merge. You will now get the Merge Clips menu having a list of options. Choose Audio option and click **OK**.

![Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-premiere-pro.jpg)

* Premiere Pro will now examine your video’s audio with the help of External audio and find out the similarities. In a couple of minutes, you will receive a new file with the name given to it in the Merge Clips menu.

## Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro

* **Step 1**: Another is the manual way to sync audio to your videos. In order to work with this uncomplicated way of synchronization, get your video clip and the audio file into the timeline. Make sure to stack up the two files loosely (do not group them).

![import files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-file-sync-audio-manually.jpg)

* **Step 2**: Now, you may have either used a professional slate/clapper or simply done a single clap with your hands to give a clue to start performing. All you need to do is to zoom the video file in the timeline. Look for the spike in waveforms that shows the slate. Where you notice the spike, slide the audio file and make the markers lined up.

![merge audio manually](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-manually.jpg)

* **Step 3**: Start playing the clip to see if it works perfectly. Just in case, if a little tweaking is still required, click the audio file and hold down the Shift key while tapping left or right arrow key to adjust the audio file as per requirement.

![finish sync audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/finish-sync-audio.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Sync Audio to Video with Plug in

[PluralEyes](https://www.redgiant.com/products/shooter-pluraleyes/) is the next ideal option to work with. It is a plug-in and comes for $200 from Red Giant. When you have the projects like documentaries which include numerous camera angles, PluralEyes easily handles such stuff and make audio and video synchronization easy for you.

* For this, run PluralEyes and hit on **Add Media** to import the clip. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file directly to Premiere Pro. Now, click on **Synchronize** and let the program do the job.

![PluralEyes sync audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sync-audio-PluralEyes.jpg)

* You will notice the synced clips in green while the files that are not synchronized will show up in red as errors. In case there are files with the red error, you need to get to the Sync drop-down menu and click **Try Really Hard**.
* When the entire files are synced, hit on **Export Timeline** and you can then drag the exported project into Premiere Pro.

## Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly

Nothing is worse than a bad quality audio file. You must have always wanted to keep a high-quality audio file, correct? More than desire, it is a vital thing to have. Hence, to record your audio appropriately, you must have a [quality microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and an [audio recorder](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-digital-voice-recorders/) that should stand out from others. This dual combination is significant in capturing the sound in an excellent quality and they indeed provide better output than an on-camera microphone.

The audio recorders with a little more price employ XLR cables. On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1/8” jacks.

You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.

Hence, to record your audio appropriately, you must have a [quality microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and an [audio recorder](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-digital-voice-recorders/) that should stand out from others. This dual combination is significant in capturing the sound in an excellent quality and they indeed provide better output than an on-camera microphone.

The audio recorders with a little more price employ XLR cables. On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1/8” jacks.

You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.
