#### 3\. Add transitions between video and photo files

All clips will be played one by one without a gap. But no transition effects will be applied by default. To add transitions, switch to Transition tab and drag any transition to the joint of two clips from almost 200 transitions (when the white box appears, release your mouse). Now, you could also add transition at the end or start of a clip.
