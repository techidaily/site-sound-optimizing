Part2\. [Steps to cut the audio from videos on iPhone](#cut-audio-on-iphone)

### Steps to cut the audio from videos on Mac

If you are using a Mac for editing, knowing that [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the best way to go about it is good but knowing how to navigate is key. Not to worry, the steps you need to get started are all listed in these three steps.

Step 1: Import Video to Filmora

Import the video to your Filmora. You can also directly drag the video into the Filmora interface.

![1index introduction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/1.index-introduction.jpg)

### Steps to cut the audio from videos on iPhone

If you want to do the mute on an iPhone, you will need to also follow some steps to get it done on your iMovie.

### Step 1: Open the iMovie

Opening the iMovie app goes beyond just clicking it to open, you also have to follow up this process by clicking the continue button that pops up. If the app has opened and you can see an inviting interface, move to the next step.

### Step 2: Select a video you want

There are different pages on the interface but your concern is on the project page. On that page, click on the plus sign button as it directs you to start or input a new video. After clicking on the plus sign, it will bring up movies that you would further select.

### Step 3: Mute the audio

Muting the audio becomes straightforward when you have moved it to the interface. In this step, click on the video clip button as seen in the picture then mute it by selecting the mute option (the picture below shows the mute sign at the lower-left corner) from the audio button. When this is done, your video has been silenced.
