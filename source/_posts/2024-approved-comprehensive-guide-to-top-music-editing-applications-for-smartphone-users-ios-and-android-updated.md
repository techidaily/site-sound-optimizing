## Part 5: Audio editing - 5 tips for mixing audio

#### Keyframe audio Levels

After fixing the primary audio, you shift your task to the new audio that you are adding to the video. Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.

#### Use filters and effects

You can apply filters/effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video/audio.

#### Volume is important

Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.

#### Change tempo

The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.

#### Use fade in and fade out

While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.

## Part 5: Audio editing - 5 tips for mixing audio

#### Keyframe audio Levels

After fixing the primary audio, you shift your task to the new audio that you are adding to the video. Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.

#### Use filters and effects

You can apply filters/effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video/audio.

#### Volume is important

Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.

#### Change tempo

The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.

#### Use fade in and fade out

While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.

## Final Verdict

Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them. It allows you to flawlessly edit audio and video files on your desktop, with multiple in-built royalty free music tracks to choose from that can enhance your video’s beauty.

#### 2\. How to add audio to video on iPhone/iPad

#### [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

If you want to add music to video in your iPhone, then the in-built iMovie option helps you import music from Theme, iTunes and your own music. Your videos will be turned into exhilarating master pieces.

You can effortlessly browse through the music files and create awesome 4K-resolution movie and Hollywood-style trailers to amaze your friends. iMovie is built to work in sync with your iOS and Mac devices.

It doesn’t matter where you are working, we mean from your iPhone to your iPad or Mac system, the project can be synced automatically as you move ahead. Once you are done editing, the movie will show up on iMovie Theatre across your iOS and Mac devices.

The step-by-step guide to add music to video using iMovie –

**Step 1:** On your iPhone launch the iMovie app and click ‘Project’ from the top of the screen, and tap ‘Create Project’ represented by a ‘+’ icon.

![imovie project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-create-project.JPG)

**Step 2:** Now, click ‘Create’ and then ‘Movie’ to open the project interface on screen. Browse the ‘Media’ option from the top left corner of the timeline and explore the video gallery on screen and pick the desired video for editing then hit ‘Add’ and then ‘Use’.

![imovie media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-media.JPG)

**Step 3:** The source video gets added to the timeline. You need to reach to the starting point of the video, so that you can add audio from there. Add audio by following similar process to that of adding video from the gallery, but tap ‘Audio’ after clicking the ‘Add Media’ button. Ensure that music has been placed at background, by tapping the ‘Background’ button from the bottom of the screen. By clicking the ‘Theme Music’ option you can find the synced media on your device.

**Step 4:** Click ‘Play’ for previewing the audio visual, and click ‘Done’ if satisfied with your new creation.

**Tip:** iMovie will loop the background audio automatically, in case the video runs longer than the audio. It is recommended to adjust their lengths while merging them.

## Part 4: How to download royalty free music from website

Few of the video editing software comes up with in-built library for music but not all of them. When there is no music with the software, you might import music from an external source to add audio to your video.

The biggest problem while using the audio tracks is copyright issues, they are not always copyright free. But, there is nothing to worry about. There are sites that offer free of cost stock music/audio tracks across genres that you can use and make a breath-taking audio visual. Let’s go through the most popular royalty free music sites.

#### [Free Stock Music](http://andrewmacarthy.com/andrew-macarthy-social-media/royalty-free-music-for-youtube-commercial-use-2016)

## Part 5: Audio editing - 5 tips for mixing audio

#### Keyframe audio Levels

After fixing the primary audio, you shift your task to the new audio that you are adding to the video. Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.

#### Use filters and effects

You can apply filters/effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video/audio.

#### Volume is important

Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.

#### Change tempo

The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.

#### Use fade in and fade out

While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.

## Final Verdict

Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them. It allows you to flawlessly edit audio and video files on your desktop, with multiple in-built royalty free music tracks to choose from that can enhance your video’s beauty.
