### Step 2: Increase or Decrease Audio Speed

Ensure that the audio track is selected in the timeline. Click the **Speedometer** icon from the timeline toolbar at the upper section, hover mouse to the **Slow** option from the menu, and click your preferred value form the submenu to reduce the sound speed. Likewise, hover the mouse to the **Fast** option, and choose a value from the submenu to increase it.

**Note:** Usually, the audio pitch wouldn't change as long as you pick the values anywhere between 0.5x and 5x. However, if you select any option beyond this range, you may experience variations in the pitch according the value you selected.

### Step 3: Set Custom Speed or Reverse the Audio

Click the **Speedometer** icon from above the timeline, and click **Custom Speed** from the menu. Use the slider to slow down (move to the left) or speed up (move to the right) the audio on the Custom Speed box. Alternatively, you can manually enter your preferred value in the available field for granular control. In addition, you can also check the **Reverse Speed** box to reverse the audio if need be.

### Step 4: Export the Output

Click **EXPORT** from the top-center area of the interface, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** box that opens next, select your preferred audio format from the **Format** list in the left, make necessary customizations from the right pane, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner of the box to export the audio with the modified speed.

## How to Change the Speed of Audio with Video in Filmora

### Step 1: Import File to Media Window and then Add to Timeline

Use the method explained in **Step 1** of the previous section to import a file to Filmora, drag the media to the timeline, and click **MATCH TO MEDIA** when the **Project Setting** box appears and prompts for confirmation. **Note:** Except for the **Project Setting** box, the rest of the process for adding audio and video files to the timeline is the same.

As for the video, you can use the trimming and cropping options to adjust its duration and size and export the entire project as explained in **Step 4** of the previous section. **Note:** To export the project as video, all you need to do is, choose a video format like MP4 or something similar to that when on the **Export** box.
