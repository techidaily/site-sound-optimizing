The process to **change audio speed** that also has a video is identical to what is explained in the previous section. The only additional step required in this case is separating the audio track from that of video.

You can learn how to get this done by following the instructions given below:

### Step 1: Import File to Media Window and then Add to Timeline

Use the method explained in **Step 1** of the previous section to import a file to Filmora, drag the media to the timeline, and click **MATCH TO MEDIA** when the **Project Setting** box appears and prompts for confirmation. **Note:** Except for the **Project Setting** box, the rest of the process for adding audio and video files to the timeline is the same.
