## Part 4: How to Set up Audacity to Record as Schedule?

A streaming video recorder or cassette can be used to arrange a recording. All of those are identical to Time Recordings in that they are used to schedule recording. The Timer record configuration dialog box may be used to set the beginning and finish of the recording. This is how you do it:

**Step 1:** By definition, the recording's **Start Date and Time** are set to the present time. It will begin recording on the present day and hour by default when you don't alter it. There is no default setting for the **End Date and Time**. You must either choose a date and time to determine the end time.

**Step 2:** There is a **Checkbox** to **Save** the work immediately. By **Ticking** the option, you may choose the path or **Folder** where the file will be saved when the recording is finished.
