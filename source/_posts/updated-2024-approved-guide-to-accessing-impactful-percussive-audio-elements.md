# How to Recognize Songs on iPhone?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

You listen to a catchy song or a tune you have never heard before and want to add it to your iPhone playlist, but you do not know any relevant details of that song to look for it online. What is the title of the song? Who sang it?

Now you can get all these details by just making the in-built iPhone music recognition feature listen to the song. Read on to know how to do that.

* [**Part 1: How to Use the In-built Music Recognition on iPhone?**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: How to Use Siri to Identify Songs by Humming on iPhone?**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Best Apps for iPhone Music Recognition**](#part3)
* [**Part 4: How to Choose a Music Recognition App?**](#part4)

## How to Use the In-built Music Recognition on iPhone?

In November 2020, Apple released the iOS 14.2 update for their iPads and iPhones. One of the features of this update was that it included built-in music and song recognition button that makes it easier for the user to recognize any song playing around them.

You just need to add the iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center menu and simply press that button when you hear a song that you like. You will then get all the information related to that song; title, artist’s name, and album title.

Here is how you add the in-built iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center:

Note: Make sure that you have the latest version of the iOS installed on your iPhone as this feature is not available on older versions. To check the running version, go to Settings -> General -> About, and then you will see the software version.

Step 1 - Open Settings> Control Center, and then tap **More** to scroll down.

Step 2- Tap the “+” button that is next to “Music Recognition”, and the iPhone music recognition button is added to the Control Center

![add music recognition feature to control center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-recognition-to-control-center-ios.jpg)

It is very easy to access and use this music recognition feature. If you have an iPhone that uses facial ID recognition to unlock, then pull down the Control Center shade by swiping down from the top right corner of the phone and tap the music recognition button.

![using  music recognition feature in iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/using-music-recognition-to-identify-song.jpg)

If your iPhone has a home button, then swipe up to get into the Control Center menu and tap the music recognition button.

You will see the Music Recognition notification icon that shows which song is playing.

The iPhone will listen for around 10 to 15 seconds once you tap the button – and will attempt to identify the song in that time period.

This feature can recognize songs playing in your environment even when your headphones are plugged in.

YouTuber Ricardo Gardener has made a video showing how to use the iPhone Music Recognition feature step by step as well, enjoy!

## How to Use Siri to Identify Songs by Humming on iPhone?

You can also identify a song on your iPhone by using its virtual assistant, Siri. Siri can recognize a song playing in your environment and even the song you are humming. This how you do it:

Step 1- Activate Siri. You can do it two ways; the first is by long-pressing the home button or Wake/Sleep button in iPhone X and the second is by the voice command “Hey Siri”.

Step 2- Then say, “Hey Siri, which song is this”. This starts Siri’s listening mode.

Step 3 - Hum the tune that you want to be identified and Siri will return with results after a few seconds.

Mike has shown us how he uses Siri to identify the song playing on iPhone, let's have a look!
