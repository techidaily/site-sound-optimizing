_“How do you remove audio from a video in Movie on an iPhone or Mac? I have a video, but I want to mute it before sharing it with my friends from my iPhone!”_

As a friend of mine asked me this, I realized that so many people find it hard to **separate audio from a video** in **iMovie** on iPhone or iPad. Since iMovie is available for Mac and iOS devices, it can ideally be used to edit your videos on the go. The best part is that it features various inbuilt features that you can use to remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone/iPad/Mac. In this post, I will let you know how do you remove audio from a video in iMovie on different devices.

## Part 1: How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on iPhone/iPad?

If you own an iPhone or an iPad, then you might be familiar with iMovie, which is an inbuilt video editor app, developed by Apple. If the app is not installed on your iOS device, then you can get it for free from the App Store. While there are several editing features in iMovie, it offers a dedicated option to control the audio level or remove it entirely from the video.

To learn how to remove sound from a video in iMovie on iPhone or iPad, you can follow these simple instructions:

**Step 1: Load the video to mute on your iMovie app**

At first, just get the iMovie app from the App Store on your iPhone or iPad and launch it. Once the iMovie app is launched, just tap on the “+” icon and choose to work on a new Movie project.

This will let you browse the available folders on your iPhone or iPad so that you can select the video to edit. Once you find the file, just select it, and load it on the iMovie interface by tapping on the “Create Movie” button.

**Step 2: Remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone/iPad**

After when the video is loaded, you can check its icon on the timeline and view its preview at the top. Now, just tap on the video icon from the timeline to get various options at the bottom.

From all the available options at the bottom panel, just tap on the sound icon. You can now scroll the bar left or right to adjust the level of audio in the video. Besides that, you can also tap on the sound icon from the side to remove audio from the video in iMovie on iPhone or iPad.

**Step 3: Save changes and export the edited video**

Once you have muted the sound in the video, just tap on the “Done” button to save the changes. After working on the project, you can tap on the share icon from the bottom and simply save the modified video on your iPad/iPhone.

If you want, you can instantly use iMovie to remove audio from a part of the clip on your iOS device. To do this, just locate your video on the device and open it. Now, tap on the “Edit” button on the top to get different options. From here, you can tap on the sound icon from the top to mute the audio component in the video.

## Part 2\. How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on Mac?

Although, the Mac app of iMovie also offers several other editing features that would come in handy to you. To learn how do you remove audio from a video in iMovie on your Mac, you can follow this simple drill.

**Step 1: Import the Video you want to edit on iMovie**

To begin with, just launch the iMovie application on your Mac and choose to work on a new project. Afterward, you can drag-and-drop the video to iMovie or click on the Import button to browse and load the file here.

**Step 2: Remove audio from the video in iMovie on Mac**

After the video has been added, you can view its thumbnail from the files section. At first, just drag the video and drop it to the timeline at the bottom so that you can make the needed edits.

Once the video is loaded, you can just right-click the video thumbnail from the timeline. Now, from the provided context menu, you can simply choose to detach audio from the file.

This will display the audio component of the file just below the video. To separate audio from the video in iMovie, you can right-click the audio component, and choose to delete it. You can further alter the audio component from here if you want to.

**Step 3: Save the Edited Video (with the Deleted Audio)**

That’s it! After making all the desired changes, you can go to the iMovie Menu > File > Share and simply choose to save the “File” of the project on your Mac.

I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. As you can see, both the Mac and iOS iMovie app lets us mute audio on any video. Though, if you are looking for more features and want to edit the sound in your videos, then you can give Wondershare Filmora a try. The application has a dedicated audio mixer and even lets us add voiceovers to videos. There are several other audio and video editing features in Wondershare Filmora that you would love to explore!
