![extract audio from video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-audio-filmora9.jpg)

After importing video to Wondershare Filmora, drag the video from the media library to the video Timeline. You can then right-click the video clip and choose “Audio Detach” to extract audio from the video. After a while, video and audio will be displayed on different tracks. If you don’t want to keep the video file, right-click it and choose “Delete” to remove it from the video timeline.

#### 3. Edit the extracted audio if you like

Double click the extracted file in the audio track and then you will see the audio editing panel.

You can add fade-in and fade-out effects, [change the sound volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjust the pitch to [change the voice](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), etc. as you like.

![edit extracted audio from video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg)

If you find some unnecessary sounds in the extracted audio file, and you want to delete them, just put the cursor to the place where you would like the deletion to start and press the “Split” button to split. The end of the deletion area can be marked similarly – play the audio and select the final point of the area to be excluded from the output audio, and then press the “Split” button again.

![split and delete unwanted part from extracted audio ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-delete-extracted-audio-min.gif)

Click the split part in the audio track, press the Delete button on the keyboard, or click the Delete icon on the toolbar to remove the unwanted audio clip.

#### 4. Save the edited audio file

After that, click the “Export” button to export the extracted audio track. Here different options are provided. For example, you can save the audio in regular formats such as MP3, MP4, WMV, AVI, and so on in the “Device” tab.

![save extracted audio in MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3-export.jpg)

To customize the audio Encoder, Sample Rate, Bit Rate or Channel settings, click the SETTINGS button to start.

Besides that, you can export the audio file for playback on portable devices, burn it to DVD or share it to YouTube directly.

Select a desirable output method and then click the “Export” button to save the audio track.

Tips: Filmora supports a wide range of audio and video formats. You can easily extract mp3 from mp4 video, or extract the audio from video and then save it in .wav format.
