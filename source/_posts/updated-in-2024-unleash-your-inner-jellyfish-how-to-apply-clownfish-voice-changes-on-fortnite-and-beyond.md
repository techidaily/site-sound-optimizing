This section will offer you a guide on how to cut out parts of audio in an iMovie project on an iPad or iPhone. After adding music to your project, the audio is trimmed to the desired length using iMovie’s inbuilt tool.

**Step #1:** Open iMovie on your iPhone or iPad.

**Step #2:** Tap the movie project you want to edit.

**Step #3:** Hit the **Edit** button below the name of your project.

**Step #4:** Add audio to your project.

Choose **Audio**.

Go with a specific category:

Soundtracks are audio tracks provided by iMovie which are free to use in your project.

Select **My Music** to locate the file and use a song from iTunes or the music app.

Sound effects are shorter sounds—mostly below 10 seconds duration.

Choose an audio file for the preview.

Select the **+** icon to add the file to your project.

### Conclusion

Glass-breaking sound effects are a great way to give your video or project some real, dramatic flair. These sounds for free online. Do an internet search, and you'll come up with plenty of sites that offer them as downloads. Note that not all of those websites will be completely free; those that only provide their glass-breaking sounds for certain uses may charge a fee after using it more than a certain number of times.

Filmora is a video editing program that's simple enough for beginners but powerful enough to satisfy even the most advanced editors. With features like manual mode and glass-breaking sound effects, you can easily create videos. Hope this article helps you with collecting glass breaking/shattering sound effects and adding them into videos using Filmora.
