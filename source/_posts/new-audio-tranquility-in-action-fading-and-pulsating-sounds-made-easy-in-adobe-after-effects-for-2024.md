Many of us get the first association when Adobe After Effects is mentioned: stunning motion graphics and breathtaking visual effects. Very few people think of audio editing when they talk about AE, even though this application offers a simple way to add Fade in and fade out effects to audio files used in soundtracks.

However, you will need to have at least basic video and sound editing skills to fade in and fade out audio files in AE since the app doesn't offer a preset that you can drag and drop to the timeline. So, in this article, we will show how to create the Fade in and fade out effects in Adobe After Effects in just a few simple steps.

## Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE

### Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects

Once you've created a new project in AE and you've imported the audio files you'd like to include in the soundtrack of the video you're making, you should place that audio file on the timeline. Click on the arrow located next to the audio file, then click on the Audio arrow that will be displayed under the file, and finally click on the Waveform arrow. This will enable you to see the waveform of the audio file you'd like to edit on the timeline and allow you to add Fade in and fade out effects with more precision. The file you added to your composition will be displayed as a layer in the Composition tab located in the lower-left region of the software's interface.

![fade out/in audio waveform after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fade-out-in-audio-after-effects-waveform.jpg)

### Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file

The next thing you will have to do is place the playhead at the exact location where you want the Fade In effect to start. In most cases, Fade effects are added at the starting point of the audio file, so you should position the playhead at the beginning of the timeline or zero seconds. You will be able to see a stopwatch next to the Audio Levels option located in the Composition tab. Click on it to add the first keyframe and assign a negative value to the Audio Level setting. -100db or -50db values will make the audio file silent, and you can pick either based on how long you want the Fade in effect to last. If you don't know how to use keyframes in After Effects, [this article will give you some info](https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/how-to-set-keyframes-after-effects).

### Step 3: Complete Fade out/in audio in After Effects

Move the playhead to the location where you want the effect to end and add another keyframe by clicking on the 'Add or remove keyframe at current time' icon. Set the Audio Level value to 0db, and that is it. You've created the Fade in effect. Keep in mind that you can use more than two keyframes to fade in audio, enabling you to increase the audio level gradually. The process of creating the Fade effect requires you to add a keyframe that has a 0db value a few seconds before the clip ends and then add another keyframe at the very end of the audio file that has -50 or -100db audio level value.

## Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects

The process of creating a fade in or a fade out effect in AE is quite simple, but it is up to you to discover creative ways of using these effects. Here are a few tips that can help you use these audio effects more creatively.

### 1\. Avoid Hard Cuts

A high pitch sound at the very begging of a new sequence can ruin your soundtrack and ultimately the entire video, so in case you've cut an audio file at the location where the sound peaks, you can apply a fade in effect to make the transition between two audio files softer.

### 2\. Be Mindful of Audio Compression

[Audio compression](https://theproaudiofiles.com/compression-techniques/) is a process that reduces loud sounds and amplifies quiet sounds, resulting from the audio file's dynamic range being compressed. In most cases, you won't notice the effects of audio compression, but if you compress an audio file too much, you might get some unwanted side effects if you add a fade out effect to that file. That's why it is best to rely on the default audio compression features a video or audio editing app offers.

### 3\. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively

Besides opening and closing scenes, you can also use the Fade in and fade out effects to mix two different tracks while the shot is still in progress. Fade out one track, make it look like a scene is ending, and then introduce a new theme that changes the mood of that scene. The important thing is to avoid reducing the audio level all the way to -100db because you might end up creating silence in a scene that disrupts the flow of an entire video.

## Conclusion

Fading in or fading out audio files in Adobe After Effects doesn't require much effort, as you have to add a few keyframes to the file and adjust the Audio Level value. However, finding the best way to improve the quality of your soundtrack by applying these effects may take some practice. Do you often add Fade in and fade out audio effects in AE? Leave a comment below and share your experiences with us.

If you want to fade in/out audio easily, we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is designed for people who wish to edit professional videos with simple-to-use features. Besides Fade in/out audio in Filmora, you can automatically sync audio to video.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows-Don't Miss It

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows

Audio normalization was commonly done in the early days when digital audio was enjoyed. The performance of many audio components was limited in signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and sound normalization helped.

Normalization is still a useful feature that helps to equalize volume in different files. Let us look at some of the best audio normalizers available in Windows.

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Wondershare Filmora is a widely used video editing application famous for its extensive video and audio editing features. The Auto Normalization in Filmora is an AI integrated feature that analyses the volume of all the clips you have selected. It then automatically adjusts the volumes to 23.0LUFS, the standard loudness level of European audio programs.

To enable Auto Normalization on Filmora:

Go to the timeline and double click on the audio clip you wish to normalize, and from the window that appears, go to Audio, select Audio Normalization, and tap OK.

The audio will be analyzed and normalized automatically within some time.

### 2\. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

Audacity is a free and open-sourced audio software used on all operating systems. Its simple interface and compatibility across different platforms are the main reasons for its popularity.

The sound normalization feature of audacity can be used to set the peak amplitude of any track. It also allows to equalize the balance of the right and left channels of any stereo tracks.

Open audacity, click on Effect from the top toolbar, and then select Normalize. Three different options will be given for you to apply.

You can remove the DC offset, independently normalize stereo channels or normalize the maximum amplitude to your desired decibel.

### 3\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

As you all might know Adobe premium pro is a wonderful video editing application used by beginners and professionals alike. To normalize audio on adobe premium pro, go to the timeline, right-click on the audio file, and tap on Audio Gain…

A small window will appear, from which you can select the Normalize Max Peak to: option. The dB can be manually adjusted to your desired limit.

Click OK after making the necessary adjustments, and the changes will take place instantly.

### 4\. [MP3Gain](http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/)

MP3Gain is an audio normalizing tool that analyses and adjusts the volumes of mp3 files so that they all have the same volume. They also ensure the original quality after the sound normalization process.

After the installation of MP3 gain on your device open it. Select Options, then Filename Display, and then Show File Only. Then tap on Add File(s) and add the files you need to normalize to MP3Gain.

This application can be used to play several songs at the same volume and the need to adjust the volume at the beginning of each song can be avoided.

### 5\. [VLC Video Player](https://www.videolan.org/)

Even though you might be familiar with VLC as a video player, it has many features that help to make changes in the audio and video of a file.

The player has a built-in sound normalization feature that can be enabled when needed. Open the player and tap on Tools from the top toolbar and then on the Preferences option. Choose to show All settings from the bottom right and select Filters under the Audio from the left panel. Tick mark the Volume normalizer option and hit the Save button.
