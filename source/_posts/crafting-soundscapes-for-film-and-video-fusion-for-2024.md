There are options to detach the audio signal from the clippings by making a right-click on the media file and selecting Detach Audio option. Add voiceover to the detached audio-video file by using the Record Voiceover feature. This brings great fun and makes your video interactive. You can also trim audio clips and add new tracks as per your requirements. Set the audio speed and duration by right-clicking the audio file.

It includes default, Classic, Low Bass, Sparkle, Pop, soft, and techno. You can also use Audio Mixer and edit the audio signals in two modes like Stereo and surround. The Audio ducking feature in Filmora helps you to lower the background music for a specific duration to enhance the voice of the speaker in the video file.
