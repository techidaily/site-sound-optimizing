Creating a soundtrack for a video is one of the most overlooked steps of the[video editing process](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Music can make any video more dynamic and more entertaining to watch. Exporting a video without [background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or voiceover included is generally considered a bad practice.

**Adding music to video online** is a good choice because you don’t need to install any video editing software on your computer. Sometimes, if the desktop video editing app installed doesn’t have [a library of royalty-free music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you have to uninstall and try other software. With online solutions, you won’t worry about this. There are several [online video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can use to add music to a video for free. In this article, I’ll share with you about how to add music to video online.

## How to Add Music to a Video Online for Free \[7 Ways\]

Editing videos online has its downsides, since some platforms have video size limitations, while others offer only a basic set of video editing tools. Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesn’t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, let’s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.

### 1\. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio

A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after they’ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesn’t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.

There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the **Creator Studio Classic** tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.

![Add Music to YouTube Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-2.jpg)

Select Audio Option

Click on the **Edit** drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the **Audio** option. Start browsing through YouTube’s collection of royalty-free music and click on the **ADD TO VIDEO** button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the **Save Changes** button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.

You can check the detailed information about [how to add music to YouTube video here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![Use Audio in YouTube Audio Library ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-audio-library-free-music-sound-effect.jpg)

YouTube Audio Library Interface

Optionally you can also download music and audio effects from YouTube Studio’s Audio Library first, and then add the downloaded music to videos with the video editor you have installed on your computer.

### 3\. Use Veed.io to Add Music to Videos

Adding music to a video file with [Veed.io](https://www.veed.io/add-music-to-video) is a straightforward process that takes a minimum amount of effort. You should simply select if you want to upload a file from your computer, a camera, your Dropbox account or via a link and wait for your video to be uploaded. Keep in mind that you cannot upload video files **larger than 50mb** if you are using the free version of the platform.

Moreover, you can click on the **Clean** button if you would like to clean the video’s audio before downloading the file to your computer or share it online.

There is nothing complicated about [combining an audio and a video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on this platform since you just have to select the files you want to merge. However, both files must be **under 200mb** in order to meet the Online Converter’s size limit.

Creating a soundtrack for a video is one of the most overlooked steps of the[video editing process](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Music can make any video more dynamic and more entertaining to watch. Exporting a video without [background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or voiceover included is generally considered a bad practice.

**Adding music to video online** is a good choice because you don’t need to install any video editing software on your computer. Sometimes, if the desktop video editing app installed doesn’t have [a library of royalty-free music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you have to uninstall and try other software. With online solutions, you won’t worry about this. There are several [online video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can use to add music to a video for free. In this article, I’ll share with you about how to add music to video online.

## How to Add Music to a Video Online for Free \[7 Ways\]

Editing videos online has its downsides, since some platforms have video size limitations, while others offer only a basic set of video editing tools. Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesn’t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, let’s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.

### 1\. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio

A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after they’ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesn’t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.

There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the **Creator Studio Classic** tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.

![Add Music to YouTube Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-2.jpg)

Select Audio Option

Click on the **Edit** drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the **Audio** option. Start browsing through YouTube’s collection of royalty-free music and click on the **ADD TO VIDEO** button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the **Save Changes** button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.

You can check the detailed information about [how to add music to YouTube video here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![Use Audio in YouTube Audio Library ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-audio-library-free-music-sound-effect.jpg)

YouTube Audio Library Interface

Optionally you can also download music and audio effects from YouTube Studio’s Audio Library first, and then add the downloaded music to videos with the video editor you have installed on your computer.

### 3\. Use Veed.io to Add Music to Videos

Adding music to a video file with [Veed.io](https://www.veed.io/add-music-to-video) is a straightforward process that takes a minimum amount of effort. You should simply select if you want to upload a file from your computer, a camera, your Dropbox account or via a link and wait for your video to be uploaded. Keep in mind that you cannot upload video files **larger than 50mb** if you are using the free version of the platform.

![Add and Edit Audio in Vdeed.io online ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/veed.io-add-music-to-video-editing-interface.jpg)

Veed.io audio uploading and editing interface

After the upload of the video is completed you should click on the Audio icon that is located on the toolbar. You’ll be prompted to upload an audio file stored on your computer and once the upload process is completed you can adjust the volume level, set the start time for the song or trim the audio file so that it matches the length of the video file. Moreover, you can click on the **Clean** button if you would like to clean the video’s audio before downloading the file to your computer or share it online.

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that lets you convert video files, compress audio files or resize images, [Online Converter](https://www.onlineconverter.com/add-audio-to-video) can also be used to add music to videos. There is nothing complicated about [combining an audio and a video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on this platform since you just have to select the files you want to merge. However, both files must be **under 200mb** in order to meet the Online Converter’s size limit.

Afterward, you should click on the Options drop-down menu and choose if you want to replace audio in video or keep audio in the video.

**Pros**

* You need an Internet connection to add music to a video for free
* No registration is required

**Cons**

* Offers only basic audio and video editing tools

In order to add music to a video with [pixiko.com](https://pixiko.com/tools/add-music) you just have to upload audio and video files to the platform. This process may take a while even though the platform limits the maximum size of the media files you can edit with it, which means that their duration cannot be too long. After the files are uploaded you should click on the Merge icon, and then click on the Merge button on the left side of the screen. The platform will automatically combine the two files so you just have to click on the Done button to complete the process.

## Silence Amplified: Simple Steps to Enhance Quality by Minimizing Unwanted Sounds in Audacity and FilmoraPro

# How to Do Noise Reduction in Audacity and FilmoraPro Easily

For a [recording to have good audio quality](https://blogs.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/4-simple-tips-for-recording-high-quality-audio/), it needs to have as little background noise as possible. Background noise is any constant sound which was not intentionally added to an audio recording. The lesser the background noise a listener can hear, the better the quality of an audio recording. This is why noise reduction is a very important part of the finishing process for audio recordings.

**Noise reduction** is the process of getting rid of any constant background noises or interfering sounds that muddy the clarity of your audio recording or distract from its substance. With noise reduction, you can get rid of constant background sounds like the hum of a machine, the buzz of a fan, whistles, whines, and hisses.

The good news is that with software like Audacity, amateurs and professionals can easily do noise reduction in a few simple steps. In this post, we show you how to easily do **noise reduction in Audacity**.

## Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/) is a lightweight opensource audio recording and editing software that’s used by many serious podcasters and vloggers. It has PC and MAC versions, and it can be downloaded with an easy-to-read manual. Before you begin the noise reduction process, assess your audio recording, taking note of parts that have background noise and the different background sounds in the recording. You should also form the habit of taking a separate recording of the ROOM TONE. You can know more infomation of Audacity from [PCmag review](https://www.pcmag.com/review/362572/audacity). This recording will provide a clear sample of the background noise in the room and will be very useful in the noise reduction process. See steps below:

* The first step is to create a NOISE PROFILE. This profile tells Audacity the nature of the noise to be reduced or eliminated from the audio recording. To create a NOISE PROFILE, open your ROOM TONE recording and click on EFFECT > NOISE REDUCTION.
* If you didn’t make a ROOM TONE recording, then open the audio file you want to process. Once opened, click and drag over a section that contains mostly noise to select it. Then, click on EFFECT > NOISE REDUCTION.

![audacity noise reduction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audacity-noise-reduction.jpg)

* Once a new window labelled ‘STEP 1’ opens, click on the ‘GET NOISE PROFILE’ button. This creates the NOISE PROFILE which Audacity will use in the noise reduction process.

![apply audacity noise reduction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/apply-noise-reduction.jpg)

* Next, select the entire audio file that requires noise reduction. Then, select NOISE REDUCTION from the EFFECTS tab on the top menu bar.
* When the new window labelled ‘STEP 2’ opens, take your time to enter the settings that give you the desired level of noise reduction. Carefully adjust the bands for NOISE REDUCTION, SENSITIVITY and FREQUENCY SMOOTHING.

![manually reduce noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/set-how-to-reduce-noise.jpg)

* Now, click the PREVIEW button to hear the effect of your noise reduction settings. If you are not satisfied with the preview, you can adjust the settings bars until you achieve a good result.
* You should also click on the RESIDUE radio button to hear the sounds that will be eliminated from your recording if your chosen settings are applied. This can be very useful as some settings can result in the loss of valuable audio content. If you hear valuable audio content captured in the residue, adjust your settings accordingly. Try as much as possible to minimize the loss of valuable audio content.
* Once you are satisfied with your audio preview and residue, click the OK button with the REDUCE radio button selected. This will perform the noise reduction effect on your audio recording.

## Conclusion

Keep in mind that noise reduction is not a perfect process and strong noise reduction settings can result in the loss of valuable audio content. Whether you choose to use Audacity or Filmora, try to strike the right balance between getting rid of background sounds and retaining valuable audio content.
