 A rapid succession of shots can make any music video or a feature film more entertaining to watch. The popularity of beat edits has gone through the roof in the era of social media videos, as so many YouTubers and video content creators produce videos that are perfectly synced to the music. This video editing technique can be used in a single scene or throughout an entire video, depending on the project and the effect you would like the video to make on the viewer. Read on if you would like to learn how to edit video clips to match the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?

 Before you start editing clips to the beat, you must first ensure that all of the materials you want to include in that video are imported into the project you created in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once the footage you intend to use in your video is in the Media Bin, you should head over to the **New** submenu in the **File menu**.

 Afterward, you can add an audio file to the timeline and ensure that the sequence settings are correct. The audio file is going to serve as the core around which you are going to build the entire video, which is why it is important to select a rhythmic song that has clearly distinguishable beats.

 Click on the **Wrench icon** and choose the **Show Audio Waveform** option from the drop-down menu, so that you can see the beats in the audio file. Make sure that the sequence you created is selected and not the audio file you added to the timeline and then position the playhead at the beginning of the song. Listening to the music to which you would like to edit your video a few times is recommended because it will enable you to better understand where the beats are located.

 When ready start adding markers to the sequence by using the **M keyboard shortcut**, so that every beat of the song contains a marker. This may take a few tries because hitting the beats can be difficult for video editors that don’t have any musical talents, but with practice, you should be able to position the markers precisely where they need to be. Also, you can make the adjustments to the video you’re creating after you sync your footage with the audio so even if the markers aren’t positioned perfectly you can make corrections later.

 Head over to the Media Bin and proceed to add **In and Out points**, by either clicking on their icons or using the **I and O buttons**, to all video clips you want to edit to the beat. By doing so you will let Adobe Premiere know which parts of the video clips you want to keep and where it should create cuts. After setting the In and Out points for all the video clips you would like to use in your project you just have to select them. The order in which your footage is selected is important as it will determine where they are going to be placed on the timeline.

 Choose the **Automate to Sequence** option from the **Clip menu** and once the Automate to Sequence window appears on the screen you should choose the **Selection Order** option from the **Ordering menu**. Afterward, you should select the **At Unnumbered Markers** setting from the **Placement menu** and change the **Method to the Overwrite Edit.**

 Make sure that the **Use In/Out Range** option is enabled and click on the **Ignore Audio** checkbox if your video clips also contain audio. Click OK to confirm the changes and Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically match your footage to the markers you added to the sequence.

## How to Edit Video Clips to the Beat of a Song with BeatEdit Extension for Adobe Premiere Pro?

 Placing markers at each beat in the song can be both difficult and time-consuming, which defeats the purpose of using Adobe Premiere Pro to automate this process. In case you are looking to save some time on adding markers to a sequence, you should try the Mamoworld’s [BeatEdit extension](https://mamoworld.com/tools/beatedit-premiere-pro) for Adobe Premiere Pro that analyses the music and adds markers automatically. Here’s how you can edit video clips to match the beat with BeatEdit.

**How to Edit Footage to the Beat in Premiere Pro with the BeatEdit Extension?**

 In order to download and install the BeatEdit in Adobe Premiere Pro, you must pay a one-time $99,99 fee. After you go through the installation process, you can launch BeatEdit from the **Extensions submenu** that is located in the Window menu.

 After the BeatEdit window pops up on the screen you should click on the **Load Music** button in order to start the beat detection process. After the audio file is analyzed blue lines are going to be displayed at each beat and you’ll be able to hear a click sound if you play the song. BeatEdit lets you adjust the volume of the audio file you analyzed and enables you to select the beats where you want to make the cuts in your footage.

 You can choose if you want to select beats evenly or randomly, specify their frequency or select the portion of the song from which you want to select the beats. The extension also lets you add extra markers that are not located at beat and adjust their amount or minimum distance. BeatEdit generates clip and sequence markers, so make sure that the sequence markers option is selected before clicking on the **Create Markers** button.

 Add the audio file you would like to use in your video to the Adobe Premiere Pro’s timeline and proceed to select the video clips in the Media Bin. Place the playhead at the beginning of the timeline and select the Automate to Sequence option from the Clip menu. You can then select the same settings you’d select if you added the markers to the sequence on your own.

**Conclusion**

 Editing videos to the beat of a song in Premiere Pro is becoming increasingly popular among video content creators. Hopefully, our tutorial has helped you learn this simple but effective video editing technique so that you can use it to make the videos your friends and followers on social media are going to enjoy watching. It is important to remember that how effective your beat edits are going to be, depends on the quality of the footage and the song selection.

## Unlocking Full Potential of Your Windows Speakers – Three Free Volume Booster Tactics

# 3 Easy Ways to Booster/Increase Volume on Windows for Free

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most computers have attached speakers, which present adequate sound levels for listening to your favorite music on your screen. However, there are instances when it seems that the volume levels aren't enough. I know how it feels when you play your favorite playlists and can't listen to them at the pitch you want. There are many possibilities to **increase volume** on your windows without speakers.

There are many methods for raising the default sound levels on Windows. You can control and **booster volume** and the audio quality on your device sometimes through some of the built-in settings and most of the time with a third-party app that may increase it by 500%.

Here in this article is a discussion about how to help **boost volume** as desired on your computer.

* [Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster](#part1)
* [Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application](#part2)
* [Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin](#part3)
* [Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora](#part4)

## Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster

Most users ignore sound and video settings within Windows without ensuring that the volume is set to a satisfactory level and the display quality is accurate. Windows has an equalizer, which you can use to improve the audio quality. The Windows 10 equalizer focuses on the critical techniques for modifying audio properties like balance and volume and can help you boost volume.

1\. Click the **Control Panel** by typing **Control** at the Windows Run prompt to have the equalizer settings. Click **Hardware and Sound** under the Sound when the Control Panel appears. This will bring up a dialogue box with a list of all of your computer's audio hardware.

![hardware and sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hardware-and-sound.jpg)

2\. The default setting for spatial Sound is to switch it off. You can, therefore, have some options for allowing spatial Sound based on your audio hardware and the software you've enabled. For example, in the picture below, there is a feature called Windows Sonic for Headphones.

![select spatial sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-select-spatial-sound.jpg)

3\. Pick the Bass Boost (or any of your profiles) and hit the **Settings** key to make adjustments. This enables Windows to display a dialogue box to adjust the raised level for each Frequency individually.

![bass boost settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-bass-boost-settings.jpg)

4\. To get to the Windows **Video Playback** settings, click the **Settings**, then **Apps**, then **Video Playback**, choose automatic processing to enhance video playback.

![video playback settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-video-playback-settings.jpg)

5\. Some more settings will be accessed via this screen that helps to change the HD color settings if your PC allows it. A preview window enables you to see how your choices would affect the final result.

![hd color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-hd-color-settings.jpg)

## Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application

Equalizer APO Application is an excellent graphic equalizer for Windows that can be used to boost volume. With VST plugin support and unlimited filters, this application is easy to use.

1\. From the start, the menu clicks in the Equalizer APO or configuration Editor.

![equalizer application menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-equalizer-application-menu.jpg)

2\. Apply the Equalizer at the given arrow part.

![apply equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-apply-equalizer.jpg)

3\. The arrow mentioned in the below picture can change **booster sound**. The sound wave will shift, and the maximum will come out; just split it with an equalizer, so it's probably best to lower the boost to avoid cutting.

![change booster-sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-change-booster-sound.jpg)

4\. Better insert the limiter at the end of the Equalizer; this may avoid clipping. Hit the plus icon, then click plugins/VST plugin.

![insert limiter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-insert-limiter.jpg)

5\. The VST container will be inserted at the end of the process.

![vst container](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-vst-container.jpg)

6\. Hit upon the file option.

![hit file option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-hit-file-option.jpg)

7\. Click the VST file when the VST preview window opens (extension .dll). VST 2 is the only format that is supported. Because there is no connection feature, you must use VST with the same number of items as Equalizer APO. Now VST can be loaded.

![load vst equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-load-vst-equalizer.jpg)

8\. Now click on the "**Open Panel**" tab.

![open panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-open-panel.jpg)

9\. The user interface is visible now. Kindly remember that, unlike DAW, the setting may not be applied until you hit the "**OK**" or "**Apply**" buttons. If "**Apply automatically**" is selected, the settings will be displayed instantly, just as in DAW.

![apply automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/14-apply-automatically.jpg)

## Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin

Another effective way to increase volume without any hassle is by using the Chrome extension. For this purpose, the Volume Master extension serves to boost volume without affecting audio quality. This extension can increase volume up to 600%. By using this, you can booster the volume of individual tabs. Plus, Volume Master is super easy to use.

Most computers have attached speakers, which present adequate sound levels for listening to your favorite music on your screen. However, there are instances when it seems that the volume levels aren't enough. I know how it feels when you play your favorite playlists and can't listen to them at the pitch you want. There are many possibilities to **increase volume** on your windows without speakers.

There are many methods for raising the default sound levels on Windows. You can control and **booster volume** and the audio quality on your device sometimes through some of the built-in settings and most of the time with a third-party app that may increase it by 500%.

Here in this article is a discussion about how to help **boost volume** as desired on your computer.

* [Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster](#part1)
* [Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application](#part2)
* [Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin](#part3)
* [Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora](#part4)

## Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster

Most users ignore sound and video settings within Windows without ensuring that the volume is set to a satisfactory level and the display quality is accurate. Windows has an equalizer, which you can use to improve the audio quality. The Windows 10 equalizer focuses on the critical techniques for modifying audio properties like balance and volume and can help you boost volume.

1\. Click the **Control Panel** by typing **Control** at the Windows Run prompt to have the equalizer settings. Click **Hardware and Sound** under the Sound when the Control Panel appears. This will bring up a dialogue box with a list of all of your computer's audio hardware.

![hardware and sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hardware-and-sound.jpg)

2\. The default setting for spatial Sound is to switch it off. You can, therefore, have some options for allowing spatial Sound based on your audio hardware and the software you've enabled. For example, in the picture below, there is a feature called Windows Sonic for Headphones.

![select spatial sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-select-spatial-sound.jpg)

3\. Pick the Bass Boost (or any of your profiles) and hit the **Settings** key to make adjustments. This enables Windows to display a dialogue box to adjust the raised level for each Frequency individually.

![bass boost settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-bass-boost-settings.jpg)

4\. To get to the Windows **Video Playback** settings, click the **Settings**, then **Apps**, then **Video Playback**, choose automatic processing to enhance video playback.

![video playback settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-video-playback-settings.jpg)

5\. Some more settings will be accessed via this screen that helps to change the HD color settings if your PC allows it. A preview window enables you to see how your choices would affect the final result.

![hd color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-hd-color-settings.jpg)

## Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application

Equalizer APO Application is an excellent graphic equalizer for Windows that can be used to boost volume. With VST plugin support and unlimited filters, this application is easy to use.

1\. From the start, the menu clicks in the Equalizer APO or configuration Editor.

![equalizer application menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-equalizer-application-menu.jpg)

2\. Apply the Equalizer at the given arrow part.

![apply equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-apply-equalizer.jpg)

3\. The arrow mentioned in the below picture can change **booster sound**. The sound wave will shift, and the maximum will come out; just split it with an equalizer, so it's probably best to lower the boost to avoid cutting.

![change booster-sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-change-booster-sound.jpg)

4\. Better insert the limiter at the end of the Equalizer; this may avoid clipping. Hit the plus icon, then click plugins/VST plugin.

![insert limiter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-insert-limiter.jpg)

5\. The VST container will be inserted at the end of the process.

![vst container](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-vst-container.jpg)

6\. Hit upon the file option.

![hit file option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-hit-file-option.jpg)

7\. Click the VST file when the VST preview window opens (extension .dll). VST 2 is the only format that is supported. Because there is no connection feature, you must use VST with the same number of items as Equalizer APO. Now VST can be loaded.

![load vst equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-load-vst-equalizer.jpg)

8\. Now click on the "**Open Panel**" tab.

![open panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-open-panel.jpg)

9\. The user interface is visible now. Kindly remember that, unlike DAW, the setting may not be applied until you hit the "**OK**" or "**Apply**" buttons. If "**Apply automatically**" is selected, the settings will be displayed instantly, just as in DAW.

![apply automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/14-apply-automatically.jpg)

## Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin

This extension can increase volume up to 600%. By using this, you can booster the volume of individual tabs. Plus, Volume Master is super easy to use.
