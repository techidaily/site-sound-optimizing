Creating a soundtrack for a video is one of the most overlooked steps of the[video editing process](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Music can make any video more dynamic and more entertaining to watch. Exporting a video without [background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or voiceover included is generally considered a bad practice.

**Adding music to video online** is a good choice because you don’t need to install any video editing software on your computer. Sometimes, if the desktop video editing app installed doesn’t have [a library of royalty-free music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you have to uninstall and try other software. With online solutions, you won’t worry about this. There are several [online video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can use to add music to a video for free. In this article, I’ll share with you about how to add music to video online.

## How to Add Music to a Video Online for Free \[7 Ways\]

Editing videos online has its downsides, since some platforms have video size limitations, while others offer only a basic set of video editing tools. Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesn’t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, let’s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.

### 1\. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio

A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after they’ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesn’t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.

There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the **Creator Studio Classic** tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.

![Add Music to YouTube Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-2.jpg)

Select Audio Option

Click on the **Edit** drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the **Audio** option. Start browsing through YouTube’s collection of royalty-free music and click on the **ADD TO VIDEO** button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the **Save Changes** button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.

You can check the detailed information about [how to add music to YouTube video here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![Use Audio in YouTube Audio Library ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-audio-library-free-music-sound-effect.jpg)

YouTube Audio Library Interface

Optionally you can also download music and audio effects from YouTube Studio’s Audio Library first, and then add the downloaded music to videos with the video editor you have installed on your computer.

### 3\. Use Veed.io to Add Music to Videos

Adding music to a video file with [Veed.io](https://www.veed.io/add-music-to-video) is a straightforward process that takes a minimum amount of effort. You should simply select if you want to upload a file from your computer, a camera, your Dropbox account or via a link and wait for your video to be uploaded. Keep in mind that you cannot upload video files **larger than 50mb** if you are using the free version of the platform.

You’ll be prompted to upload an audio file stored on your computer and once the upload process is completed you can adjust the volume level, set the start time for the song or trim the audio file so that it matches the length of the video file. Moreover, you can click on the **Clean** button if you would like to clean the video’s audio before downloading the file to your computer or share it online.

There is nothing complicated about [combining an audio and a video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on this platform since you just have to select the files you want to merge. However, both files must be **under 200mb** in order to meet the Online Converter’s size limit.

Creating a soundtrack for a video is one of the most overlooked steps of the[video editing process](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Music can make any video more dynamic and more entertaining to watch. Exporting a video without [background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or voiceover included is generally considered a bad practice.

**Adding music to video online** is a good choice because you don’t need to install any video editing software on your computer. Sometimes, if the desktop video editing app installed doesn’t have [a library of royalty-free music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you have to uninstall and try other software. With online solutions, you won’t worry about this. There are several [online video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can use to add music to a video for free. In this article, I’ll share with you about how to add music to video online.

## How to Add Music to a Video Online for Free \[7 Ways\]

Editing videos online has its downsides, since some platforms have video size limitations, while others offer only a basic set of video editing tools. Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesn’t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, let’s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.

### 1\. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio

A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after they’ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesn’t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.

There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the **Creator Studio Classic** tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.

![Add Music to YouTube Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-2.jpg)

Select Audio Option

Click on the **Edit** drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the **Audio** option. Start browsing through YouTube’s collection of royalty-free music and click on the **ADD TO VIDEO** button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the **Save Changes** button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.

You can check the detailed information about [how to add music to YouTube video here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![Use Audio in YouTube Audio Library ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-audio-library-free-music-sound-effect.jpg)

YouTube Audio Library Interface

Optionally you can also download music and audio effects from YouTube Studio’s Audio Library first, and then add the downloaded music to videos with the video editor you have installed on your computer.

### 3\. Use Veed.io to Add Music to Videos

Adding music to a video file with [Veed.io](https://www.veed.io/add-music-to-video) is a straightforward process that takes a minimum amount of effort. You should simply select if you want to upload a file from your computer, a camera, your Dropbox account or via a link and wait for your video to be uploaded. Keep in mind that you cannot upload video files **larger than 50mb** if you are using the free version of the platform.

Moreover, you can click on the **Clean** button if you would like to clean the video’s audio before downloading the file to your computer or share it online.

There is nothing complicated about [combining an audio and a video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on this platform since you just have to select the files you want to merge. However, both files must be **under 200mb** in order to meet the Online Converter’s size limit.

Want a program that can change audio volume so that it won’t be too loud or too quiet? Though many media players or speakers have volume control during playback, it still can be an annoying problem and it takes time to set it. And some downloaded files are rather low to listen to even you raise the volume to the maximum level on the computer. So it's advisable to **normalize the volume** permanently.
