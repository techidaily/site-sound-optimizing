## "MP4 File Optimization: Removing Unwanted Audio Tracks"

While editing an MP4 (MPEG/MPG) clip, we may want to remove audio from the MP4 file completely instead of muting the audio and getting only the video stream as an output.

Sometimes we may want to remove audio from the original file and add a new sound tracker.

To help finish this task, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the right choice. With it, you can either delete all audio tracks completely from MP4 to get the video with no audio in it at all. Or remove an extra audio track and only keep the one you like.

The following article will introduce a simple way of removing audio from video in whatever situation.
