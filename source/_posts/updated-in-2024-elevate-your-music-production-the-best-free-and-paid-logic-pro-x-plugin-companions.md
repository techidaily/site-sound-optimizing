## Preserving Audio Integrity: Techniques for Altering Pitch in Audacity

You may raise or lower the pitch of a pre-recorded song. Likewise, you may apply the pitch-changing effect in real-time sound recording. Change in pitch affects your noise in certain ways. For instance, it can help you sound younger. Similarly, it can convert the male voice into a female voice. Another notable use of the pitch-changing technique is that you can produce sounds like cartoons. So, changing pitch can add a unique touch to your voice. You can also change pitch when recording in Audacity. The following article covers details about the **Audacity change pitch** feature. Let’s get started.

#### In this article

01 [What is pitch, and how does it work?](#part1)

02 [How to Change Pitch in Audacity?](#part2)

## Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?

Not all sounds are the same. Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.

On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.

## Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?

Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries. Several applications offer sound editing tools to serve the needs of the people. Pitch-changing is one of the common tools that people look for in sound editors.

Audacity is one of the notable software that allows users to change the pitch of the voice. It comes with an **Audacity pitch shift** mechanism to facilitate users. So, if you are editing sound in Audacity, changing the pitch is just a matter of a few clicks. Are you still wondering how you can apply the **Audacity change pitch** technique when editing? Here’s how you can do it in simple steps.

**Step 1: Select the audio portion**

Launch Audacity and add sound recordings you want to edit. Click on the timeline and drag to select the portion of the sound.

**Note:** Only the portion whose pitch you want to change.

![select audio portion to change pitch audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-audio-portion-to-change-pitch-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2: Open Effect menu**

Click on the **Effect** tab at the top right of the screen next to **Generate.** Select **Pitch Change** from the drop-down menu.

**Note:** You can also make other changes, such as **Change Speed** and **Change Tempo** option will let you alter the speed of the sound. So, the pitch can also be altered using this process.

## Bonus Section: How to Adjust Sound Louder in Audacity?

Volume in an audio file may or may not be ideal for use. Sometimes, the sound is too loud or low. Audacity can help you in such a situation. So, if you are editing sound recordings in Audacity, you can also fix the volume of the sound. The good thing to note is that you can adjust the sound in both directions, which implies you can easily amplify or reduce the volume in these open-source applications. Are you interested in knowing about the volume adjustment process in Audacity? If yes, we have summarized the process in simple steps. Let’s take a look.

**Step 1:** **Add an audio file**

Launch the software and click on **File**. Select **Open** and select the desired audio.

**Note:** It is not recommended to change the volume through the playback volume knob at the top right corner of the screen, as this will only increase the volume in your device. However, the actual volume of the audio will remain unchanged.

![open audacity audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-audacity-audio-file.jpg)

**Step 2:** Increase/Decrease audio gain

Change the gain of the audio at the left-hand side of the screen. Move the slider to adjust the volume to the desired level.

![adjust audio gain audacity sound louder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-audio-gain-audacity-sound-louder.jpg)

**Conclusion**

There are high chances of audio sound not being in the required pitch or volume. Plus, you may also need to change the sound characteristics of an audio file for specific use. So, if this is the case, the Audacity change pitch technique is all you need to learn. Thus, we have summarized the process of changing pitch and volume in a step-by-step guide in this article. Hopefully, all your concerns will have been addressed.
