## From Airwaves to Hard Drives: A Comprehensive Manual for Computer-Based Podcast Archiving

Listening to Podcasts is a great way to gather information. Name a topic, and you will find a Podcast on it. You can always count on the best Podcast shows to get quality knowledge.

You can listen to those Podcasts online. But, sometimes, users want to download the Podcast. The reason can be anything; you might want to listen offline. There are various ways to get the job done. We will walk you through different methods to download Podcasts to the computer.

## Can you download a Podcast as a file?

Yes, it's possible. But the process is a bit different for many platforms.

If you're downloading Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify and Apple Play. These apps will save your Podcast in the app's library and make it available for offline listening.

Yet, you can't get access to the saved Podcast on the PC. For this, you need third-party tools to download them to your computer. A step-by-step process of using apps and tools is given below!

But if you're downloading a Podcast from a video platform like YouTube, then yes. You can download it as a file. Here are a few methods to download podcasts. Let's walk you through them one by one.

## Method 1- Direct Download Podcasts From Podcast Manager Apps
