Step 1: Open Wondershare Filmora, create a new project and import your files to get started.

![open new project classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-3.jpg)

Step 2: Now drag video clips and photos on the timeline and arrange the sequences and clips.

![arrange videos on timeline classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-4.jpg)

Step 3: If the photo size doesn’t match the video size, you can change the ratio in the crop section. This changes the aspect ratio of the video.

![set image size classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-5.jpg)

Step 4: Set the ratio for all videos and images.

Step 5: Now open the titles tab and search weddings. You can choose from a myriad of wedding-style templates on Filmora.

![add titles classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-6.jpg)

Step 6: Once you choose the title, you can drag it on your timeline. The title tag will look incredible at the start and the ending. Thus, you have to choose two title tags.

Step 7: Double-click on the first title and click on the advanced buttons. This feature enables you to customize your tags add change color, text, and fonts.

![edit title tags classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-7.jpg)

Step 8: Make the same changes for the second title tag as well.

Step 9: After selecting the right title tag, you can include elements on your images or video clips.

Step 10: Go to the Effects tab and search wedding floral. A wide range of options will appear in the media section. Choose the tags that you like the most and drag them on a new track.

Step 11: Now it’s time to add the titles to introduce the bride and groom. Furthermore, this section will also include the wedding location and other details for the wedding.

Step 12: Move to the transition section add transition presets and search for the effects you like for your video. Choose the transition and drag between the clips.

![add transitions classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-9.jpg)

Step 13: Your wedding invitation is almost ready. All you need to add is classical background music. For that, you can search the music from the audio tab or choose from the above-mentioned options. Also, you can import music from your computer to use in the video

Step 14: You can export the video from the tool and send your friends and family on Whastapp or post it on Facebook.

### Closing Words

The above-mentioned classical background music will enhance the sentiments in your wedding videos. Music helps the audience to connect with your emotions. Therefore, you should choose the classical background music carefully according to each segment. It would be best to list the video sections on a piece of paper and write the song’s name in front of it. That way, you will get a complete overview of your video’s layout.

You can use [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create your wedding videos and invitation. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing tool with advanced features. The effects and templates simplify the editing task and you can create emotional wedding videos in minutes.
