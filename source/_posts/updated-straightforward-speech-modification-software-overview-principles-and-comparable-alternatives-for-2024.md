## "Capturing Auditory Essence: Waveform Visualization & Dynamic Animations in Avid Media Composer"

The amplitude and duration of an audio waveform vary with the duration and volume of the underlying sound. Finding specific edit locations when editing footage or keyframing effects is made simpler by these characteristics. Audio waveforms in Final Cut Pro alter based on the volume of a clip or any applied effects. When the volume is high, the waveform is larger; when the volume is low, it is smaller. But when using FCP to edit video, people frequently experience issues with **audio waveform disappearing**. Or you do want to **add some dynamic effects for audio waves**? Continue reading!

## Part 1\. How to show Audio Waveform on clips in FCP?

When working with audio waveforms on the timeline, you can zoom in or out, or change the appearance of the clip to make the waveform taller or shorter.

There are numerous methods to examine and interact with the audio and video contained within clips in Final Cut Pro. You can:

* Expand a clip to see and modify audio elements at the channel level
* Expand a clip to view separate audio and video
* Separate audio from video clip to work with audio and video as separate, independent clips
* Change the appearance of the clipped background to display **reference waveforms** that make it easier to view audio waveforms when the volume is reduced

The reference curve shows the maximum visual resolution possible for the current sound curve. By accounting for changes in volume, the reference waveforms allow you to see the details of the sound more clearly.

1. Choose Final Cut Pro > **Preferences**, then click Edit.
2. Check the **"Show reference waveforms"** box.

When the actual curve changes shape (for example, when it shrinks because the clip's volume level is low), its full reference curve is still visible for easy reference when editing.

![audio waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/final-cut-pro-audio-waveform-1.png)

**Tips:** You can click the shortcut **“Control+Option+1”** to adjust the clip appearance setting to display clips on the timeline with large audio waveforms only.

## Transform Your Singing with Autotune in Audacity – A Complete Tutorial Followed Through

You might be surprised to learn that audacity's many default audio effects do not include an autotune feature if you have ever had to correct a song's pitch or tuning. Not to worry!. GSnap is a free plugin that lets you use autotune (not to be confused with Auto-Tune) in audacity. On Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux computers, you can autotune and adjust the pitch of recorded files using GSnap.

This article will guide you to download the audacity autotune plugin to your computer and install it. Then you will be able to adjust the pitch of your sounds easily and tune them automatically without any hassle. This is a free download that can be installed in audacity to help you fine-tune your live vocal performance. During vocal pitch correction, it allows audacity to expand its functionality.

## **How Does Auto-tune Works?**

Negative feedback from listeners is a common occurrence for singers. They need to satisfy their audience by giving them their most perfect production numbers. Nevertheless, there are instances when they need the aid of a device to conceal their mistakes or avoid making them. So they lip-sync and autotune their prerecorded songs.

Singers and music producers are not the only ones to use autotune. The most common users are ordinary people who have made music creation a part of their lives. Then how does autotuning operate?

The pitch is raised to the nearest correct tone when a person sings with the key off (out-of-tune). Moreover, the distortion can mask the out-of-tune parts (especially the highest and lowest pitches) in the overall performance.

## **How To Add Autotune To Audacity Using GSnap?**
