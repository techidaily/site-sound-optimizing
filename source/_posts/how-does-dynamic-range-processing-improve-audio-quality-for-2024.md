Wondershare Filmora brings its users an extensive range of audio and video editing features. There is so much one can do with their hands on this software. This section of the article will discuss other audio-relative features of Filmora:

### 1\. [AI Audio Denoise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

There are multiple forms of background noises and techniques to remove them. Filmora's denoise features provide multiple techniques for denoising. Users can employ its audio enhancement feature to improve speech. Moreover, it has wind removal, hiss, and hum removing options. You can also employ its reverb reduction to minimize echo in your content.

### 2\. [Silence Detection](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

One of the many ways of uplifting your content’s audio is to remove the silent pauses. Locating and eliminating silent parts of video is difficult by yourself. This AI auto-detects and eliminates the silent parts of videos with precision. It will optimize your videos for the audience, as the pauses may irritate them.

### 3\. [Audio Ducking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Being a content creator can be challenging in terms of precise editing. In Filmora, you do not need to adjust the audio elements of each track separately. With its audio ducking feature, users can fade one audio track to clarify the other. It auto-detects the speech parts of videos and decreases the music levels in them.

### 4\. [Auto Beat Sync](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you wish to align your video footage with an external audio track, this is the best option. Filmora's audio beat sync streamlines your content with its functionality. Its Auto Montage Maker synchronizes content and adds effects according to beat points. Moreover, it can auto-enhance your content by fixing the overexposed or dark portions.
