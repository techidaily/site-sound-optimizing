Magisto generates videos automatically and syncs the cuts to the beats of the song you selected. The only downside is that you are not going to have any control over how the videos are synced to the beats or make any changes after a video is generated.

**Conclusion**

Sound and music are often overlooked during the video editing process, which often reduces the quality of a video. A simple video editing technique like syncing the cuts with beats of a song can help you create dynamic videos that gather thousands of views, shares, and likes on social media. However, having the right sync video to music beat app is essential if you want to create professional-looking videos. Which app are you going to use to sync videos to the beats of a song?

### 2\. [Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html)

**Price:** $59.99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Premiere Elements was created to simplify and automate the video editing process, which is the reason why syncing video clips to the beats of a song is a quick and easy process. You just have to add an audio file to the timeline and use the app’s Beat Detection feature to add markers to the song you selected.

**Price:** $20,99 as a single app

Moving images are far less convincing if they are not accompanied by sound. That is the reason why all of the [glitch visual effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you add to your videos are going to be much more impactful if you add sound effects to them. Making glitch sound effects on your own can prove to be a demanding task, especially if you are not a skilled sound designer, but luckily you can solve this problem by downloading the effect that fits a particular sequence perfectly from the Internet. So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online destinations where you can find a huge number of different glitch effects you can use in all of your projects for free.

If you are running the latest version of [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or version after V10.5, you can now find the glitch sound in the Audio library directly by typing glitch in the search bar.

![Filmora free glitch sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitch-sound-filmora.jpg)

You can then directly drag the audio to the track in the timeline and edit it accordingly.

## The Best Online Destinations Where You Can Download Glitch Sound Effects for Free

There are so many different types of glitches you can add to your videos, and each of them creates a different impression when paired with a different sound. Experimenting with sounds until you find the one that fits the visuals perfectly is probably the best way to make a glitch effect more realistic. Let’s take a look at some of the best websites that offer free glitch sound effects.

#### 1. [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/glitches/)

![ZapSplat online glitch sound effect download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zapsplat-glitches-sound-effect-category.jpg)

ZapSplat is currently one of the largest online sound libraries that offers huge selections of royalty-free music and sound effects. The sound effects are organized by categories so you can browse through Explosion, Industrial or Nature categories while searching for effects you want to use in your video. The Glitches category contains a huge selection of different glitch sound effects that can be downloaded in either mp3 or wav formats. However, you must first create an account and become a Gold member of the ZapSplat community in order to be able to download these effects.

#### 2. [Storyblocks](https://www.audioblocks.com/royalty-free-audio/computer+glitch+sound+effect)

![storyblocks online glitch sound effect download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyblocks-glitch-sound-effect.jpg)

Besides audio files, you can also find stock photos and videos on this platform, but before you can start downloading files you must first create an account. Moreover, some footage isn’t going to be available unless you choose to purchase a monthly or an annual subscription plan. Most glitch sound effects you can find on Audioblocks, the version of the Storyblocks platform dedicated solely to audio files, last only for a couple of seconds, which means that you can’t really use them for glitch scenes that are longer than that. Even though Audioblocks can be a valuable resource, the sound effects you can find here are only useful for short glitch sequences.

#### 3. [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/dotY21/packs/16933/)

![Freesound online glitch sound effect download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freesound-glitch-effect.jpg)

## The Best Online Destinations Where You Can Download Glitch Sound Effects for Free

There are so many different types of glitches you can add to your videos, and each of them creates a different impression when paired with a different sound. Experimenting with sounds until you find the one that fits the visuals perfectly is probably the best way to make a glitch effect more realistic. Let’s take a look at some of the best websites that offer free glitch sound effects.
