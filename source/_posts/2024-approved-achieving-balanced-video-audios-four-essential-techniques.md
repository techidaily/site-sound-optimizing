Some of the greatest film directors of all time have used sound to make the scenes in their movies more dramatic, romantic or to build suspense. The importance of sound for the overall quality of a video is often overlooked by young filmmakers, as they tend to dedicate all of their attention to the visual part of their projects.

The fact of the matter is that even a minor error in the video’s soundtrack can distract the viewer and ruin a video completely. That’s why, in this article, we are going to show you four different methods of adjusting the audio volume in Filmora.

## Four Ways of Adjusting Audio Volume in Filmora

The audio clips often have different volume levels, so in order to create a balanced soundtrack, you have to adjust the volume of each audio track you intend to use in your projects. Filmora offers several different ways to adjust the volume of audio files quickly and effortlessly. Here’s how you can increase or decrease the volume of the audio clips in Filmora.

#### 1. Changing the Audio Volume of Entire Track

This is probably the easiest and fastest way to adjust the volume of a video or an audio file in Filmora. After you import the file into a project you just have to add it to a certain position on the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging and dropping the file at the location on the timeline where you want the file to be placed. Click on the **Add Track menu** that is located in the upper left corner of the timeline and select the **Big option** from the **Adjust Track Height** submenu.

Enlarging the video and audio tracks will enable you to see the **audio volume line** that is displayed over all clips that contain sound you add to the timeline. **Click on the line and drag it upwards if you would like to increase the volume or drag it downwards if you want to decrease the volume of an audio or a video file.**

#### 2. Applying the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Change the Audio Volume Partially

Once you add an audio clip to an audio track on Filmora’s timeline, you can adjust its volume from the **Audio Editing panel.** Double-clicking on an audio file will bring up the Audio Editing panel that contains **Fade In and Fade Out** sliders. Both sliders are going to be set to zero by default, so you just have to drag each of them to the right in order to create the Fade In or Fade Out effect.

Filmora also lets you create the Fade In and Fade Out effect directly from the timeline, as you just have to **hover** **the mouse over an audio file and drag the Fade In or Fade Out markers** to set the duration of the effect for that particular file.

#### 3. Using the Volume Slider to Change the Audio Volume

On the left side of the Audio Editing panel that can be accessed by double clicking on an audio file, you will be able to see the **volume slider.** Its value is going to be set to **0 dB** by default and you just have to **drag it upward or downward** in order to adjust the audio volume. As you drag the slider the new audio volume value is going to be displayed in a box below the slider. The **left/right balance value** can be adjusted by **dragging the knob** that is located above the volume slider in either direction. Alternatively, you can **insert a new numerical value in the box** below the knob. If the displayed value is **0 dB, then the left and right channels are balanced**, while the value of **\-100 dB** means that all the sound goes through the left channel and if the displayed value is **100 dB** all the sound will go through the right channel.

![stereo-mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stereo-mode.jpg)

#### 4. Adding Keyframes to Adjust the Audio Volume

Once you add an audio file to the timeline you can adjust its volume by **adding keyframes** to it. **Place** **the playhead to the exact spot in the audio file** where you want to add the first keyframe and then **double click on the file to bring up the Audio Editing panel**. Click on the **Add Volume Keyframes** icon and **use the volume slider to adjust the volume** at the position of the first keyframe.

![animation-customize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-customize.jpg)

Simply **move the playhead and change the value on the volume slider** to add new keyframes to the audio file. This method of adjusting audio volume enables you to set different volume values for different parts of an audio file.[](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## "Zen in Your Screen Time: Exploring the Most Calming Digital Spaces "

Our daily lives are filled with a lot of events that can lead to a lot of stress and agitation. Working on a particular project with a certain client to meet a looming deadline can be an important part of your job. Many solutions are available, but what happens when you're working on your computer and have no spare time? This is where the Internet comes in handy.

Several websites exist that will assist you in achieving a sense of inner peace. Among other things, they use captivating images and soothing sounds to accomplish this. Here are the 10 best calming websites that could help you relax those nerves if you feel like you could use some quick and effective relaxation. We are sure that if you try these websites, they will help you a lot.

### 1.[Calm](http://www.calm.com/)

![calm-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/calm-poster.png)

The name itself suggests that Calm can help you achieve your goals. There are two ways to get there: guided calm or timer. A session can last anywhere from two to twenty minutes. You will hear a voice guide you on how to relax tense muscles and the mind when you choose the guided calm option. Alternatively, you can use the "timer" button to conduct a quick session without narration.

In addition to the music, the nature scenes depicted, such as misty riverside scenes and rays of sunlight streaming through clouds, add an extra touch. You can also download the Calm iPhone app for free but it will have limited features.

### 2.[Do Nothing For 2 Minutes](http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/)

![do-nothing-for-2-minutes-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/do-nothing-for-2-minutes-poster.png)

Its title speaks for itself. There won't be any other activity for two minutes except listening to the waves. The purpose of this website is to test your ability to resist doing nothing. If you touch your keyboard or mouse, you will get a failure message, and the clock will reset again if you do. The majority of people fail several times before they complete the task. It is quite fun and challenging at the same time. While you focus on completing the challenge, you will forget all the worries on your mind.

Taking a quick break of 2 minutes can sometimes be all you need to reset your mind. It's also available as an app (for iOS).

### 3.[Multiplayer Piano](https://multiplayerpiano.com/)

![multiplayer-piano-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/multiplayer-piano-poster.png)

You can play multiplayer piano online. In the end, everyone plays simultaneously, and it's crazy but fun. Both your mouse and keyboard can be used. Also available on the site are the possibilities of starting a chat with some random 'composers' or playing by yourself. If you don't want to play in multiplayer mode, you can switch to solo mode. You can also record the piano that you play and then listen to it. Overall this website is quite fun.

### 4.[Simply Noise](http://simplynoise.com/)

![simply-noise-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simply-noise-poster.png)

Relax with this free color noise generator. Using an audio spectrum of low to high frequencies, the site offers a variety of colored noises. Each color represents a different sound and calming effect, with white being the softest and pink being the loudest. Keeping your workspace white prevents distractions, pink sounds like a calming waterfall, and brown is good for sleeping and relieving migraines. You can control the volume using either the volume knob or the oscillation button, automatically changing the volume.

### 5.[Get Relaxed](https://getrelaxed.com/)

![get-relaxed-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-relaxed-poster.png)

Trying GetRelaxed might be the answer you're looking for if sitting still for 2 minutes doesn't appeal to you. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the beautiful images in the slideshow (the images change every three seconds). Choose from several soundscapes to complete the experience. A total of 15 soundscapes are available. They last between two and four minutes. You might be surprised by how easy it is to get back in touch with nature.

### 6.[Naturesoundsfor.me](http://naturesoundsfor.me/)

![naturesoundsfor-me-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/naturesoundsfor-me-poster.png)

There are more than four kinds of sounds to choose from with naturesoundsfor.me: tribal drums, animals, fireworks, heartbeats, etc. Using a combination of different sounds like beach, child, and water, etc. You can easily create sounds according to your preferences. Create your own! Listening to the sound of the waves gently crashing on the shore as children giggle in the background is soothing yet lively. It can also be downloaded and played when you're offline.

### 7.[A Soft Murmur](https://asoftmurmur.com/)

![a-soft-murmur-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/a-soft-murmur-poster.png)

An easy-to-use website that lets you mix ambient noises to your liking. A special mix can include the soothing sounds of rain, singing bowls, and my favorite, the sound of a fireplace. The ambient noises can be played simultaneously, or you can pick and choose as you need. Focusing on the task at hand will be easier with the sounds. Alternatively, you can share your mix on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram if you'd like.

### 8.[Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/)

![XXXXXXXXXXXXX](https://picsum.photos/960/420)

Various background noises are produced on this website, including coffee shop chatter, low fan sound, white noise, and more. Depending on your mood, you can adjust the volume of the sounds. You can also change the color of the web page depending on the mood of the sound you have selected.

For those who love multitasking, there's also a Text Editor function so they can write without distractions. You can even save your work. Additionally, Noisli offers an app (iOS) so you can stay calm no matter where you are.

### 9.[Focus@Will](https://home.focusatwill.com/)

![focus-will-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-will-poster.png)

Focus@Will is awesome! When you read, write, or study while listening to phase-sequenced instrumental music, your attention span is increased by 400 percent. In addition, it extends the standard productivity cycle from 20 to 30 minutes to approximately 100 minutes.

It engages your background attention such that you don't notice it interfering with your conscious focus on the task you're working on (Alpha Chill works for me). As far as the costs are concerned, there are three account types to choose from: Guest, Personal, and Pro.

### 10.[Raining.fm](https://raining.fm/)

![raining-fm-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/raining-fm-poster.png)

Occasionally, all we need to soothe ourselves is a little rain. Listening to rain sounds on Raining.fm helps you relax. There is no way to tell that this is looped audio because it is so well done. A quick break reminder, an image slideshow, and a timer to silence the sound are also included.

When it's time to stretch your legs and take a quick break, the reminder will let you know. Both iOS and Android users can download the Raining.fm app.

## **Final Verdict**

If you are feeling stressed due to your daily hectic routine or facing focus issues, all you may need is a little escape. This is our list of the 10 best calming websites that you can find on the internet. These websites will only take a few minutes and help you to get control over your nerves.

The name itself suggests that Calm can help you achieve your goals. There are two ways to get there: guided calm or timer. A session can last anywhere from two to twenty minutes. You will hear a voice guide you on how to relax tense muscles and the mind when you choose the guided calm option. Alternatively, you can use the "timer" button to conduct a quick session without narration.

In addition to the music, the nature scenes depicted, such as misty riverside scenes and rays of sunlight streaming through clouds, add an extra touch. You can also download the Calm iPhone app for free but it will have limited features.

### 2.[Do Nothing For 2 Minutes](http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/)

![do-nothing-for-2-minutes-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/do-nothing-for-2-minutes-poster.png)

Its title speaks for itself. There won't be any other activity for two minutes except listening to the waves. The purpose of this website is to test your ability to resist doing nothing. If you touch your keyboard or mouse, you will get a failure message, and the clock will reset again if you do. The majority of people fail several times before they complete the task. It is quite fun and challenging at the same time. While you focus on completing the challenge, you will forget all the worries on your mind.

Taking a quick break of 2 minutes can sometimes be all you need to reset your mind. It's also available as an app (for iOS).

### 3.[Multiplayer Piano](https://multiplayerpiano.com/)

![multiplayer-piano-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/multiplayer-piano-poster.png)

You can play multiplayer piano online. In the end, everyone plays simultaneously, and it's crazy but fun. Both your mouse and keyboard can be used. Also available on the site are the possibilities of starting a chat with some random 'composers' or playing by yourself. If you don't want to play in multiplayer mode, you can switch to solo mode. You can also record the piano that you play and then listen to it. Overall this website is quite fun.

### 4.[Simply Noise](http://simplynoise.com/)

![simply-noise-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simply-noise-poster.png)

Relax with this free color noise generator. Using an audio spectrum of low to high frequencies, the site offers a variety of colored noises. Each color represents a different sound and calming effect, with white being the softest and pink being the loudest. Keeping your workspace white prevents distractions, pink sounds like a calming waterfall, and brown is good for sleeping and relieving migraines. You can control the volume using either the volume knob or the oscillation button, automatically changing the volume.

### 5.[Get Relaxed](https://getrelaxed.com/)

![get-relaxed-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-relaxed-poster.png)

Trying GetRelaxed might be the answer you're looking for if sitting still for 2 minutes doesn't appeal to you. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the beautiful images in the slideshow (the images change every three seconds). Choose from several soundscapes to complete the experience. A total of 15 soundscapes are available. They last between two and four minutes. You might be surprised by how easy it is to get back in touch with nature.

### 6.[Naturesoundsfor.me](http://naturesoundsfor.me/)

![naturesoundsfor-me-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/naturesoundsfor-me-poster.png)

There are more than four kinds of sounds to choose from with naturesoundsfor.me: tribal drums, animals, fireworks, heartbeats, etc. Using a combination of different sounds like beach, child, and water, etc. You can easily create sounds according to your preferences. Create your own! Listening to the sound of the waves gently crashing on the shore as children giggle in the background is soothing yet lively. It can also be downloaded and played when you're offline.

### 7.[A Soft Murmur](https://asoftmurmur.com/)

![a-soft-murmur-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/a-soft-murmur-poster.png)

An easy-to-use website that lets you mix ambient noises to your liking. A special mix can include the soothing sounds of rain, singing bowls, and my favorite, the sound of a fireplace. The ambient noises can be played simultaneously, or you can pick and choose as you need. Focusing on the task at hand will be easier with the sounds. Alternatively, you can share your mix on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram if you'd like.

### 8.[Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/)

![XXXXXXXXXXXXX](https://picsum.photos/960/420)

Various background noises are produced on this website, including coffee shop chatter, low fan sound, white noise, and more. Depending on your mood, you can adjust the volume of the sounds. You can also change the color of the web page depending on the mood of the sound you have selected.

For those who love multitasking, there's also a Text Editor function so they can write without distractions. You can even save your work. Additionally, Noisli offers an app (iOS) so you can stay calm no matter where you are.
