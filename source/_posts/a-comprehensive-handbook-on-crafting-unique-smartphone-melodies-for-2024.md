On the other hand, a video podcaster is obliged to present its audience with informative content. Whether in the version of a startup, interview, conversational, or a repurposed content, almost every video podcast is highly instructive.

**Type of Versions**

You can have a video podcast in different versions or formats, including Interviews, Startup Conversations, Laptop Lifestyles, First Launch Conversations, Solo/ Monologue, Co-Hosting, or Hosting Regular Show. On the other hand, vlogging comes in various versions or types, namely Lifestyle, Makeup, Gaming, Fitness, Unboxing, and Reviews.
