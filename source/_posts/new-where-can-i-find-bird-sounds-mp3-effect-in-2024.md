Microphone selection is a crucial component in making sound effects during recording. You use sensitive mics for interior scenes to capture subtle nuances make good audio. Here we preferably recommend hyper-cardioid condenser mics.

Consider also placement and closeness of the microphone as they significantly affect the sound effect recorded concerning the sound source. For close-up shots, use closer microphone placement, but if you desire more room sound, put distance between the mic and the sound source.

In this busy world where everything is happening fast, it is very important to keep up. Nowadays, everyone in different instances tends to share information in the form of voice messages. Be it long lectures, product information, briefings, etc. voice recordings are shared very much across the world.

But it is difficult to retrieve information from long audio and hence there is a need to convert audio to text. It is much easier to access information if it's available in text form rather than audio form. It also enables us to selectively access and marks the needed information. Applications like Speechnotes and dictation allow us to record and convert audio to texts. These applications help us to save time for typing as well as in accessing the information later.

It’s been some time since people have been receiving information in the form of audio files. From college lectures and audible notes to project meetings, interviews, etc. a large amount of information is being shared through audios. But audio files make it hard to access the information whenever you choose as it can be buried in hours of recordings.

So there is a need to convert these audios into texts. Texts are easy to access and it is also possible to selectively choose the information you need whenever you need it.

But you might be worrying about how to convert hours of recordings to texts. Don’t worry, due to the advancement of technology, there are now a lot of applications available to us that can **transcribe audio to text** free.
