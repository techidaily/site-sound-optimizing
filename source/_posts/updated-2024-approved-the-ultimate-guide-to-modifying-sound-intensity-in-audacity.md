## The Ultimate Guide to Modifying Sound Intensity in Audacity

Audacity is a free, open access, cross-platform sound editing and recording tool. It is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and various other operating systems. All of these aspects have contributed to Audacity's worldwide popularity. Audacity features an amplified effect that alters the loudness of your chosen audio and other practical tools that can change the sound in different ways.

As a result, Audacity can not only assist you in modifying the level of an audio file, but it can also help you equalize, reduce, normalize, and so on.

Yes, you have heard it right, **Audacity increase volume**, but the primary question is how? But don't worry, you will get the answer after reading the article. This article will explain how you can increase or decrease the volume of a whole and a specific segment of the audio file. Let's get started.

## Part 1: How to Increase or Decrease Volume Without Distortion and Clipping in Audacity

Audio clipping occurs when the audio input becomes too loud for an amplifier to produce, and the surplus signal creates distortion. When editing, you cannot add additional volume to your audio clip forever because this would result in clipping. In this case, you can use the Audacity application to emphasize your material by turning the volume up or down without distortion and clipping on a track or recording.

Learn how **Audacity increase volume without distortion** by following the procedure described below:

**Step 1:** First, download and install the Audacity software on your computer.

**Step 2:** Select the **File** from the menu above and click **Open** to open the audio file.

**Step 3:** Choose the audio track, go to the **Effect** menu and pick the **Amplify** option from the drop-down menu.

![audacity effects amplify adjust audio volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-effects-amplify-adjust-audio-volume.jpg)

**Note:** You can increase or decrease the volume by double-clicking the track and using the slider under the **Gain** title.

**Step 4:** Increase or decrease the volume by sliding the slider or typing the amplification value in the text box next to it in the Amplify window as needed.

![increase decrease audio volume audacity amplify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/increase-decrease-audio-volume-audacity-amplify.jpg)

**Note:** Ensure that the **Allow Clipping** checkbox remains unchecked to avoid clipping. Moreover, keep in mind that increasing the volume to a greater extent can result in distortion.

Audacity is an open-source audio editing tool. It is used for various purposes, like audio recording, music creation, and audio file editing. It also allows you to increase and decrease the volume of audio files.

You may also apply the modifications to multiple files at once, rather than one at a time. Check out the instructions below to learn how to change the volume of multiple audio files:

**Step 1:** Select the **Import** option from the **File** menu, and then pick the **Audio** option. Browse to your audio files, choose all of them, and then click the Open option.

![import audio files to audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-audio-files-to-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2:** To select all the files, press **Ctrl + A**, click on the **Effect** option in the menu bar and pick **Amplify.**

![select multiple audio files audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-multiple-audio-files-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, either enter the value in the text box next to the **Amplification Decibels** tab or use the slider under it. To verify the operation of increasing the volume, check the **allow clipping** checkbox. When you're through with the options, click the **Ok** button.

![adjust multiple audio files amplify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-multiple-audio-files-amplify.jpg)

**Step 4:** Amplification will be applied to all the tracks. Go to the File option from the above menu to export the files and then select the **Export** option.

![export amplified audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-amplified-audio-audacity.jpg)

If you’re running Audacity on macOS computer, you can watch the video tutorial below to apply effects to multiple files.

## Part 3: How to Increase Volume in Certain Parts of Track?

The audacity software also allows you to alter a specific section of an audio file. The selection tool can assist in locating a particular area of the track. After you've chosen a section of the audio file, you may utilize the amplification effect to increase its loudness. Check out the instructions below to learn how you can achieve it:

**Step 1:** Launch the Audacity software on the computer. To open the audio file, go to the **File** menu and select **Open**. You may also open the file by dragging it.

**Step 2:** Ensure that the **Selection tool** is active now. Click and hold the mouse left-click to move from one spot on the track to another.

![select part of audio file audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-part-of-audio-file-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** After picking the part, go to the **Effect** option from the menu and select **Amplify**.

![amplify part of audio files audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-part-of-audio-files-audacity.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, for that specific region, modify the amplification and click **OK**. This will only change the volume for the area you have selected.

![adjust part of audio amplification audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-part-of-audio-amplification-audacity.jpg)

## Part 4: What's the Difference between Normalize and Amplify?

Amplify and Normalize are two essential features of the Audacity tool. Many people think they are the same thing, they are right up to some extent, but there exists a big difference between both the features. Before discussing the differences, you need to know what the terms Normalize and Amplify imply.

### **Amplify**

It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect's name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.

Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.

![amplify audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-audio-audacity.jpg)

### **Normalize**

The meaning of [normalizing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.

As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.

By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard. Shrink the size of each noise source, such as the name, and normalize the sound.

![audacity normalize interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-normalize-interface.jpg)

**Related**: [Best Audio Normalizers for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### **Differences**

To differentiate the meaning and impact precisely, amplification means increasing or reducing the sound, whereas normalizing means equalizing the sound. Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.

When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.

## **Conclusion**

All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing. If you simply need to modify an audio file, Audacity is a great option. For increasing and decreasing the volume of single and multiple audio files, Audacity is still one of the best bets in the market. We hope that now know how **Audacity increase volume** of the audio files after reading this article.

It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect's name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.

Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.

### **Normalize**

The meaning of [normalizing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.

As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.

By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard. Shrink the size of each noise source, such as the name, and normalize the sound.

**Related**: [Best Audio Normalizers for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### **Differences**

To differentiate the meaning and impact precisely, amplification means increasing or reducing the sound, whereas normalizing means equalizing the sound. Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.

When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.

## **Conclusion**

All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing. If you simply need to modify an audio file, Audacity is a great option. For increasing and decreasing the volume of single and multiple audio files, Audacity is still one of the best bets in the market. We hope that now know how **Audacity increase volume** of the audio files after reading this article.

For office purposes, the dictation apps of Otter or Dragon might be the best for you. If mailing and preparing documents are your purposes then Speechnotes or Braina can do the job. If you don’t want to spend any money on dictation apps, you can go for the free ones like Google Voice Docs typing.

### 2\. [Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html)

**Price:** $59.99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Premiere Elements was created to simplify and automate the video editing process, which is the reason why syncing video clips to the beats of a song is a quick and easy process. You just have to add an audio file to the timeline and use the app’s Beat Detection feature to add markers to the song you selected. Customizing the settings of the Beat Detection option won’t take you much more than a few moments, but you should keep in mind that this tool is only available in the Expert view of the app. Furthermore, you can add new markers to an audio file from the Expert timeline by clicking on the Set Beat Marker icon if you want to make more cuts in your videos.

### 3\. [Cyberlink PowerDirector](https://www.cyberlink.com/)

**Price:** $99,99

### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20,99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Premiere Pro is much more than a simple sync video to music beat app because it is probably one of the most powerful video editing software products ever created.

### 5\. [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

**Price:** $299,99

**Compatibility:** macOS

![FCPX - sync video to the beat of a song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download-app.jpg)

There are several different ways to sync videos to the music beats in Final Cut Pro X, but this video editing software doesn’t allow you to add beat markers automatically. Installing the BeatMark X application will enable you to add markers to the audio file you want to use as a soundtrack of your video and create an XML file you can import into Final Cut Pro X. However, automating the process of adding the footage and creating the cuts isn’t possible, although the video editor lets you use generators that somewhat simplify this process. FCPX is a professional video editing software equipped with all the tools that are necessary to create a full-feature film, which makes it a bad and expensive choice for inexperienced video editors who are just looking for a quick way to sync their videos to the beat of a song. For more studio-problem, please see this article: **[Practical Guide on How to Sync Audio and Video in Final Cut Pro X 2021](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).**

### 7.Quik – GoPro Video Editor

### 8\. [Beat Sync Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beat-sync-maker/id1434787464)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 11.0 or later

The maximum duration of a video you can export from the free version of this app is limited to just thirty seconds, and you must make an in-app purchase if you want to create longer videos with Beat Sync Maker.

### 9\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS 11.0 or later](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magisto-video-editor/id486781045), [Android 5.0 and up](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magisto&hl=en), web-based

![magisto-upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magisto-upload.jpg)

Video content creators who don’t want to go through the video editing process every time they want to post a new video on social media should consider using Magisto. The app’s AI automatically merges photos or videos and creates the content you can share on social media in just a few minutes. Magisto lets you choose from different editing styles like Memories, Pets or Holidays, and enables you to import footage from the device’s gallery or from Google Photos. The app also grants you access to a huge music library of songs you can use free of charge, but it also allows you to import the music you want to use in a video. Magisto generates videos automatically and syncs the cuts to the beats of the song you selected. The only downside is that you are not going to have any control over how the videos are synced to the beats or make any changes after a video is generated.

**Conclusion**

Sound and music are often overlooked during the video editing process, which often reduces the quality of a video. A simple video editing technique like syncing the cuts with beats of a song can help you create dynamic videos that gather thousands of views, shares, and likes on social media. However, having the right sync video to music beat app is essential if you want to create professional-looking videos. Which app are you going to use to sync videos to the beats of a song?

Here are some of the best sync video to music beat apps for Smartphones, Mac, and PC computers.

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The new version of Filmora now features the Auto Beat Sync tool, which can be used to adjust the music with the video clips automatically. It would definitely save your time and make video editing easier for you. Check the below videos to learn more about Filmora's Auto Beat Sync

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2\. [Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html)

**Price:** $59.99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Premiere Elements was created to simplify and automate the video editing process, which is the reason why syncing video clips to the beats of a song is a quick and easy process. You just have to add an audio file to the timeline and use the app’s Beat Detection feature to add markers to the song you selected. Customizing the settings of the Beat Detection option won’t take you much more than a few moments, but you should keep in mind that this tool is only available in the Expert view of the app. Furthermore, you can add new markers to an audio file from the Expert timeline by clicking on the Set Beat Marker icon if you want to make more cuts in your videos.

### 3\. [Cyberlink PowerDirector](https://www.cyberlink.com/)

**Price:** $99,99

**Compatibility:** Windows

Cyberlink PowerDirector lets you detect beats and generate markers both automatically and manually, which enables you to choose the method that is best suited for the project you are working on. After you add an audio file to the app’s timeline, you should right-click on it and chose the Use Automatic Music Beat Detection option.

You can then set the minimum amount of time between two beat markers and click on the Detect button if you want to add markers automatically. Optionally you can also add markers during playback manually by clicking on the Add button or using the A keyboard shortcut. When done you should click on the Apply button in the Automatic Music Beat Detection dialogue box and beat markers are going to be added to the timeline automatically. Nonetheless, you must edit all video clips you want to add to your project manually.

### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20,99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Premiere Pro is much more than a simple sync video to music beat app because it is probably one of the most powerful video editing software products ever created. The process of editing a video to the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical since you have to add all the markers to a sequence manually, set In and Out points for each clip you would like to add to the timeline, and automate that sequence so that the app can place your footage on the timeline in the order you selected. The BeatEdit extension can help you automate the process of adding beat markers to a sequence you created in Adobe Premiere Pro, but you must spend a hundred dollars on this extension if you want to generate markers automatically.

### 5\. [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

**Price:** $299,99

**Compatibility:** macOS

![FCPX - sync video to the beat of a song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download-app.jpg)

There are several different ways to sync videos to the music beats in Final Cut Pro X, but this video editing software doesn’t allow you to add beat markers automatically. Installing the BeatMark X application will enable you to add markers to the audio file you want to use as a soundtrack of your video and create an XML file you can import into Final Cut Pro X. However, automating the process of adding the footage and creating the cuts isn’t possible, although the video editor lets you use generators that somewhat simplify this process. FCPX is a professional video editing software equipped with all the tools that are necessary to create a full-feature film, which makes it a bad and expensive choice for inexperienced video editors who are just looking for a quick way to sync their videos to the beat of a song. For more studio-problem, please see this article: **[Practical Guide on How to Sync Audio and Video in Final Cut Pro X 2021](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).**
