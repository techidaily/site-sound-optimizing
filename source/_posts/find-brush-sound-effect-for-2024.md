## How to Sync Videos to the Beat of a Song in Three Different Ways

Editing a video to the beat of a song requires some previous preparation because you must have all the materials in place before you start adding footage to the FCPX’s timeline. Most importantly the song you choose as a soundtrack for your video needs to have a rhythm you can use to easily sync videos and make cuts so that they match the song’s beat perfectly. So let’s have a look at three different techniques you can use to edit to the beat of a song.

### Add Markers Manually and Snap Videos to the Beats of a Song

Once you’ve imported all of your footage into a project you created in FCPX, you should place the song you want to use in your video to the audio track on the timeline. You must then isolate the audio file by either clicking on the **Solo icon** that looks like headphones on the editor’s timeline, selecting the Solo option from the Clip menu or using the **OPTION + S** keyboard shortcut.

Play the audio file you isolated and start adding markers at the beats in the songs where you want to make cuts. It is worth noting that you don’t have to add a marker at each beat, and you should listen to the song a few times in order to find perfect spots where you are going to make the cuts. Place the playhead at the beginning of the audio file, click on the **Play button**, and press the **M key** to start adding markers. You can count on the beat or tap your foot in order to make keeping up with the pace of the beats easier. Switching to the waveform view can also help you add markers more accurately and reduce the amount of time you have to spend searching for a beat.

Proceed to **disable the Solo option** after you add all markers to the song, and use the **N keyboard shortcut** to activate the **Snapping feature** before you add video clips to the timeline. Afterward, simply arrange the clips in the order you want them to appear in the video and preview the results. If some cuts are not positioned perfectly you can easily readjust them so that they are synced to the beat of the song.

A little complicated for you? Then try Filmora, a beginner-friendly tool, and do it in an easy.

### Cut to the Beat and Sync Audio with Video in FCPX

Final Cut Pro X doesn’t allow its users to line up their cuts automatically, which is the reason why you have to go through this process manually. Click on the **Titles and Generators icon** and then place the **Custom generator** to the video track on the timeline.

You should then add the song you want to use in your video to the audio track, connect it to the Custom generator and make sure that the duration of these two files matches. Listen to the song a few times before selecting both the generator and the audio file and then hold the **Command button and press the B button** to make cuts at beats throughout the song.

Drag a video clip from the Media Library and hold it over the section of the Custom generator until you see the **Film Strip icon**. Drop the video clip and select either the **Replace from Start, Replace from End or Replace with Retime to Fit** options. Keep adding video clips to this until you replace all parts of the generator with the footage you want to include in your video.

![Enhance2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Enhance2.jpg)

You can also delete cuts you’ve made on the generator by simply selecting the start or the end of a generator clip and pressing the delete button on the keyboard. Choose the Replace with Retime to Fit option in case a video clip is shorter than the segment of the generator you are trying to replace. FCPX will automatically slow down your clip and extend it to fit between two cuts. Optionally, you can use the Trim tool to align your cuts to the beats of the song perfectly, if they are a bit off, before previewing and exporting the video you created.

## Maximizing Speaker Output: Cost-Free Tips for Windows Users

# 3 Easy Ways to Booster/Increase Volume on Windows for Free

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most computers have attached speakers, which present adequate sound levels for listening to your favorite music on your screen. However, there are instances when it seems that the volume levels aren't enough. I know how it feels when you play your favorite playlists and can't listen to them at the pitch you want. There are many possibilities to **increase volume** on your windows without speakers.

There are many methods for raising the default sound levels on Windows. You can control and **booster volume** and the audio quality on your device sometimes through some of the built-in settings and most of the time with a third-party app that may increase it by 500%.

Here in this article is a discussion about how to help **boost volume** as desired on your computer.

* [Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster](#part1)
* [Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application](#part2)
* [Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin](#part3)
* [Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora](#part4)

## Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster

Most users ignore sound and video settings within Windows without ensuring that the volume is set to a satisfactory level and the display quality is accurate. Windows has an equalizer, which you can use to improve the audio quality. The Windows 10 equalizer focuses on the critical techniques for modifying audio properties like balance and volume and can help you boost volume.

1\. Click the **Control Panel** by typing **Control** at the Windows Run prompt to have the equalizer settings. Click **Hardware and Sound** under the Sound when the Control Panel appears. This will bring up a dialogue box with a list of all of your computer's audio hardware.

![hardware and sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hardware-and-sound.jpg)

2\. The default setting for spatial Sound is to switch it off. You can, therefore, have some options for allowing spatial Sound based on your audio hardware and the software you've enabled. For example, in the picture below, there is a feature called Windows Sonic for Headphones.

4\. Better insert the limiter at the end of the Equalizer; this may avoid clipping. Hit the plus icon, then click plugins/VST plugin.

8\. Now click on the "**Open Panel**" tab.

## Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin

Another effective way to increase volume without any hassle is by using the Chrome extension. For this purpose, the Volume Master extension serves to boost volume without affecting audio quality. This extension can increase volume up to 600%. By using this, you can booster the volume of individual tabs. Plus, Volume Master is super easy to use.

With a simple slider, the usability and convenience of this extension are impressive. Through this, you can enhance, reduce, or increase the volume of a specific tab without affecting the default web browser or system volume settings.

There are three steps to increase volume by using the chrome booster volume plugin.

1\. First, open **Google Chrome**, then move to **Chrome Web Store**. By searching the **Volume Master** here, you will be directed to the link which will open the extension page. Here hit the **Add to Chrome button**.
