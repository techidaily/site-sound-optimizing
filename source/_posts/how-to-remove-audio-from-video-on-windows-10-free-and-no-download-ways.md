## Part 4\. Solution to Fix Clownfish Voice Changer Not Working

While using Clownfish Voice Changer, you might also come across some troubles. They might be because either the voice changer is not updated, or maybe the apps you are using are not up to date. Let us share some fixes with you for smooth Clownfish functioning.

### Fix 1: Update Clownfish Voice Changer

The most significant reason why you face trouble is that your Clownfish version is outdated. For this, you should update the voice changer to its latest version by following the steps given below:

Step 1: You have to start by opening the ‘Control Panel’ from the ‘Run’ window. For that, press ‘Windows and R’ together and then type ‘Control’ and press 'Enter.' Now, look for the 'Programs' section, and under that section, click on the 'Uninstall a Program.'

![tap on uninstall a program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-12.jpg)

Step 2: A list of all the installed programs will appear on the screen. From that list, look for ‘Clownfish Voice Changer’ and then left-click on it. Lastly, select the option of 'Uninstall.'

![click on uninstall button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-13.jpg)

Step 3: Once this is done successfully, head over to the [official website of Clownfish Voice Changer](https://clownfish-translator.com/voicechanger/download.html) and install the latest version. Restart your computer and open the application to check if the problem has been resolved or not.

### Fix 2: Check the Application’s Version

Another reason that might be causing the problem is an incompatible version of the application with Clownfish. Both the voice changer and the application must have compatible versions. You can take assistance from the steps below to check the version of Skype.

Step 1: Start by opening Skype, and then from the left menu pane, click on your Skype profile. Then, from the quick access menu list, look for the ‘Settings’ option.

![open skype settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-15.jpg)

Step 2: After the ‘Settings’ window opens, click on the 'Help & Feedback’ option once located from the left pane. As the Help & Feedback screen opens, you will see the Skype logo on the screen, and under the logo, you will see the version of Skype.

![confirm skype version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-16.jpg)

### Fix 3: Microphone Installation in Clownfish

The Voice changer is of no use if the microphone cannot be used as a microphone is an essential component for using a voice changer. An outdated microphone or wrongly installed microphone can cause an error in using Clownfish voice change.

Step 1: Run Clownfish on the computer and open it from the taskbar icon by right-clicking it. Keep your mouse over 'Setup’ till the sub-menu opens.

Step 2: From the sub-menu, click on ‘System Integration.' Then, select the microphone which is working fine, and click on 'Install,' which will install the microphone automatically.
