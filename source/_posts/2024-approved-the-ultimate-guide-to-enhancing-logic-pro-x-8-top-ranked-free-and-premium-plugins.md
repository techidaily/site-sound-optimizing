### 2\. [Silence Detection](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

One of the many ways of uplifting your content’s audio is to remove the silent pauses. Locating and eliminating silent parts of video is difficult by yourself. This AI auto-detects and eliminates the silent parts of videos with precision. It will optimize your videos for the audience, as the pauses may irritate them.

### 3\. [Audio Ducking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Being a content creator can be challenging in terms of precise editing. In Filmora, you do not need to adjust the audio elements of each track separately. With its audio ducking feature, users can fade one audio track to clarify the other. It auto-detects the speech parts of videos and decreases the music levels in them.

### 4\. [Auto Beat Sync](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you wish to align your video footage with an external audio track, this is the best option. Filmora's audio beat sync streamlines your content with its functionality. Its Auto Montage Maker synchronizes content and adds effects according to beat points. Moreover, it can auto-enhance your content by fixing the overexposed or dark portions.

### Using AI Vocal Remover in Wondershare Filmora
