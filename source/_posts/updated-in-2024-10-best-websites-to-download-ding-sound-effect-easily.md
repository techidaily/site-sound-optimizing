## Part 1\. Types of Jazz Music

Over the years, this music style has evolved a lot. The evolutions were made to meet the popular music standards, pop, funk, rock, etc. With this, jazz has a variety of different styles. A lot of people don't have enough knowledge about the wide range of jazz styles.

The jazz background music is a crazy fusion and mix of hymns, ragtime, marching bands, folk music, etc. The music has traveled from streets to dance halls and drinking clubs. Let us add more to your knowledge by sharing the types of jazz music.

### · Early Jazz

The earliest style of jazz background music is the 'Early Jazz.' The style came to be in the late 1800s or the early 1900s. The style took off in New Orleans. It was famous as 'playing hot' or 'ragtime.' The rhythms and the syncopated notes became popular among the audience.

The bands used to have cornet, trombone, 1 or 2 wind instruments, violin, drums, and clarinet. Louis Armstrong, Buddy Bolden, King Oliver are some early jazz band artists.

### · Free Jazz

The next type of jazz background music that we are sharing is 'Free Jazz.' The style is also known as 'Avant Garde.' This jazz style emerged between the 1950s and 1980s. Free jazz style bought freshness to jazz music which was much needed at that time.

As the name represents, this style of Jazz is free of rules. The musicians weren’t bound to anything. They had a free hand to do anything. Free Jazz was often negatively targeted and criticized.

### · Big Band

Big band is another type of jazz music. This is also referred to as 'Swing' jazz background music. The style began in the 1930s. It had a stronger emphasis on the rhythm part. Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, and Artie Shaw are among the outstanding instrumentalists of Swing bands.

The style used piano, drums, and guitar. These rhymes were mixed with saxophone, violin, trumpet, clarinet, and also trombone to make the perfect jazz style.

### · Latin Jazz

The next style is Latin Jazz. This is the steady rhythm jazz background music. Latin Jazz is a combination of Afro Cuban and Afro Brazilian. The Afro Brazilian jazz is subtle, whereas the Afro Cuban jazz is dance-based. In Latin Jazz, claves are used instead of using backbeat. Woodwind instruments were also used. Candido Camero, Chick Corea, and a few others are famous for Latin Jazz.

### · Bebop

The most intellectual of all the jazz background styles is Bebop. The style began in the mid-1940s. It was a crazy mix of trumpet, piano, and saxophone.
