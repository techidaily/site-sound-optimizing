To **normalize audio** is to apply a constant amount of gain to a recording to bring the amplitude to a target or norm. Or simply put, normalizing any audio file with a normalizer software searches the file for a peak volume to set a defined maximum and then brings up the rest of the audio to the same maximum level.

**Audio normalization** is a good practice to get your audio levels right for a better-balanced video, especially imperative for dialogue clips that stand out on YouTube and other platforms. However, out of many different reasons, getting the best audio results from old-fashioned AD/DA converters or matching a group of audios on the same volume levels are still the most common.

Nevertheless, it's not always easy to find an efficient audio normalization tool and – most importantly – to master the process. But no worries because we have you covered. So, dive in to learn some of the best tools and how you can use them to create masterfully balanced soundtracks.

## FAQs about Normalizing Audio

Here we sorted out some frequently asked questions about audio normalization, which can help you learn more about **audio normalization.**

### 1\. What dB should I normalize audio to?

Well, that entirely depends on your audio use, and there is no exact number for normalizing an audio clip. However, for safety, the trick is to stay from the maximum volume level of 0 dB. For overall mix levels, most video editors recommend normalizing audio between -10 dB to -20 dB. Likewise, in the case of a dialogue clip, the recommended audio levels are -12 dB to -15 dB. Still some other suggestions are

* Music: -18 dB to -22 dB
* Soundeffects: -10 dB to -20 dB

### 2\. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?

**Audio normalization** only and purely changes the volume of a sound by applying a constant amount of gain with a goal to make the loudest peak reach 0 Db. And while normalizing also matches multiple audios to the same volume, it still does not affect the sound dynamics, unlike compression.

On the flip side, audio compression chops off the audio peaks in your recording to get a fuller, louder sound without reaching the clipping limit. In compression, you are changing a proportion of the audio over time in varying amounts.

### 3\. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?

Fortunately, no. **Audio normalization**, when appropriately done with the help of efficient audio editors, never affects the audio quality. When normalizing an audio clip, the digital bit having the highest level below 0 dB is identified, and all the other bits of the audio are amplified to the same level. This translates to no change in the relative difference between every bit, while the noise level also does not change. So, yes, the only thing affected is the output level and not the quality of the track.

#### Summing up

**Audio normalization** is an emerging trend as a good idea to manage high-quality audio levels. This feature can indeed benefit the final steps of mastering music production. However, you need to be careful when deciding where and when to **normalize audio** or avoid it for better results.

So, are you ready to level up your audio game? The above-mentioned audio editing tools are top-notch normalizers that will do the work for you. Also, don't forget to try Wondershare Filmora's distinctive auto normalization feature to produce studio-quality audio.

## FAQs about Normalizing Audio

Here we sorted out some frequently asked questions about audio normalization, which can help you learn more about **audio normalization.**

### 1\. What dB should I normalize audio to?

Well, that entirely depends on your audio use, and there is no exact number for normalizing an audio clip. However, for safety, the trick is to stay from the maximum volume level of 0 dB. For overall mix levels, most video editors recommend normalizing audio between -10 dB to -20 dB. Likewise, in the case of a dialogue clip, the recommended audio levels are -12 dB to -15 dB. Still some other suggestions are

* Music: -18 dB to -22 dB
* Soundeffects: -10 dB to -20 dB

### 2\. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?

**Audio normalization** only and purely changes the volume of a sound by applying a constant amount of gain with a goal to make the loudest peak reach 0 Db. And while normalizing also matches multiple audios to the same volume, it still does not affect the sound dynamics, unlike compression.

On the flip side, audio compression chops off the audio peaks in your recording to get a fuller, louder sound without reaching the clipping limit. In compression, you are changing a proportion of the audio over time in varying amounts.

### 3\. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?

Fortunately, no. **Audio normalization**, when appropriately done with the help of efficient audio editors, never affects the audio quality. When normalizing an audio clip, the digital bit having the highest level below 0 dB is identified, and all the other bits of the audio are amplified to the same level. This translates to no change in the relative difference between every bit, while the noise level also does not change. So, yes, the only thing affected is the output level and not the quality of the track.

#### Summing up

**Audio normalization** is an emerging trend as a good idea to manage high-quality audio levels. This feature can indeed benefit the final steps of mastering music production. However, you need to be careful when deciding where and when to **normalize audio** or avoid it for better results.

So, are you ready to level up your audio game? The above-mentioned audio editing tools are top-notch normalizers that will do the work for you. Also, don't forget to try Wondershare Filmora's distinctive auto normalization feature to produce studio-quality audio.

To **normalize audio** is to apply a constant amount of gain to a recording to bring the amplitude to a target or norm. Or simply put, normalizing any audio file with a normalizer software searches the file for a peak volume to set a defined maximum and then brings up the rest of the audio to the same maximum level.

**Audio normalization** is a good practice to get your audio levels right for a better-balanced video, especially imperative for dialogue clips that stand out on YouTube and other platforms. However, out of many different reasons, getting the best audio results from old-fashioned AD/DA converters or matching a group of audios on the same volume levels are still the most common.

Nevertheless, it's not always easy to find an efficient audio normalization tool and – most importantly – to master the process. But no worries because we have you covered. So, dive in to learn some of the best tools and how you can use them to create masterfully balanced soundtracks.

Here is **how to remove static noise from audio** with Filmora.

Step1 Upload Files

Open Wondershare Filmora and load your video into the timeline window. You can get a video preview, cut it up, and remove the bits you don't want to preserve.

Step2 Edit Audio

Select "Edit Audio" by using the context menu after right-clicking the movie in the timeline. You will see four options: silence detection, modify audio, disconnect audio, and mute. Choose the "Audio" option from the drop-down menu if you want to separate the audio from the video.

Step3 Remove Background Static

You may also double-click the video clip in the timeline to reach the Editing panel without first separating the audio from the video.

## Part 3: How to Record Noise-Free Audio?

So, that was **how to remove static sound from audio**. But what if you record noise-free audio instead?

If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.

If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn't there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.

Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.

Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.

One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists. If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.

## Conclusion

Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem? Video quality is vital, but audio noise can quickly damage your film. However, **removing static sound from audio** may be a pain in the neck. In addition, capturing clear audio may be challenging, particularly in areas with a lot of background noise.

Now you have an audio file with less or no noise and want to learn **how to remove static noise from audio**. With the above suggestions, I hope you'll find eliminating background noise from the video easy. If you want to be more creative in removing **static noise from audio**, try the Filmora video editor to give your mind a boost.
