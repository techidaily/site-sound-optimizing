Step4 Move your cursor over the Podcast episodes and click the download button to download them to your computer.

The backward of using Podcast manager apps is that it can only save your Podcast in the manager app. If you uninstall the app accidentally, you lose access to the saved Podcast because it won't be available on your PC.

To cope with this problem, we provide third-party apps to directly download the Podcast to your computer from the manager apps.

## Method 2- Download Podcasts From Popular Podcast Manager Apps Using Third-Party Tools

To download Podcasts in unprotected formats from Spotify, you need a third-party tool to alter Spotify .ogg audio. The most helpful and commonly used tool is TuneFab Spotify Music Converter. It is free for 30 days, and you can purchase it after discovering it is compatible with you!

It will convert Podcasts and as well as download songs, audiobooks, and playlists into MP3, WAV, FLAC, and M4V. Follow the below instructions to get your hands on it!

Step1 First, download [TuneFab Spotify Music Converter](https://www.tunefab.com/sp-music-converter/), then follow the outlines on the screen to get set up on your computer. Then launch this tool to start the conversion process.

## FAQs

### When you save a Podcast, where does it go?

Saved Podcasts are usually added to the saved list in your Podcast library and will be available for offline listening.
