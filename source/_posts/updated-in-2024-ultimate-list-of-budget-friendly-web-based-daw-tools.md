Are you invested in detaching the audio process? Worry no more as we have got you. Premiere Pro doesn't leave its users empty-handed. Audio extraction and separation both would be included in this section.

### Audio Extraction Process

The audio extraction procedure is a great way to lubricate the editing process. The audio is extracted to add new audio master clips in this phenomenon. The channel mapping, duration, gain, speed, and footage adjustment are applied to the extracted clips. The original content remains preserved.

Before detaching audio, let us shift our focus to extracting it. So, are you with us? Follow the step-by-step below to extract audio from the video.

Step 1: Launching Premiere Pro

Open Adobe Premiere Pro. Press 'New Project' from the interface that appears. The default settings are good to go. However, make sure that the output location is appropriate. Hit 'OK.'

Step 2: Importing the Clips

Now, click on 'Media Browser' from the middle panel. Import the targeted video clips to initiate the process. Select the videos whose audio has to be extracted. Head to the 'Clip' section and choose 'Audio Options.' Hit 'Extract Audio' afterward.

Step 3: File Extraction

In a couple of seconds, Premiere Pro creates duplicate audio files. The original video clips are not affected in any way. Moving on, let us move on to export the extracted audio clips.

Step 4: Exporting Process

Mark in and out points on your sequence for the session you wish to export. Mute the rest of the tracks. Now, navigate to the 'File,' press 'Export,' and then 'Media.' For encoding format, choose between MP3 and WAV form audio based on the original file format. Choose the output location. Hit 'Export,' and you are done.

### Audio Detaching Process

Similarly, audio separation is another way to access a part of the audio. It permits you to use any audio section and make necessary edits to it. To detach audio in Premiere Pro, kindly follow the guidelines below.

Step 1: Importing the Media Files

Launch Premiere Pro from your computer. The interface opens up in seconds. The user is recommended to browse the targeted video with attached audio. Add it to the timeline of the Premiere Pro.

Step 2: Unlinking Process

After that, right-click on the clip. Choose 'Unlink' from the list of options that appear. The user can easily select and edit both the audio and video content. However, you can also separate audio using another faster process.

Step 3: Deleting Process
