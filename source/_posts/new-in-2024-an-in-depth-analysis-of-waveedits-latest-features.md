##### Step4

##### Step5

Now, you have to finalize everything. Before posting the video, you will get an option with a notification. If you click the ‘yes’ button, it will help you preview the video and figure out everything is perfect or not. In case you consider the ‘no’ button, it will eliminate the preview and proceed to publish the video. Within a few minutes, your video will be posted on IGTV and visible to the audience.

### For Desktop – Step-By-Step Guide

##### Step1

Firstly, you need to proceed by opening Instagram on a desktop, no matter Windows or Mac. Here, you should log in to Instagram Web by using credentials. You should log in account by using the official sources only. Don’t fall for fake websites or scammers.

##### Step2

Now, you should access your account profile. Here, you can see multiple buttons in the interface. You should proceed by choosing the ‘IGTV’ button. You can see this button between the ‘post’ and ‘saved’ buttons.

##### Step3

In the IGTV interface, you can see the ‘upload’ button as well. Clicking this particular button will allow you to access the video upload interface and procedure.

##### Step4

The video that you want to upload on IGTV should be available on your device. By using the interface, you can access device storage and upload the desired video.

##### Step5

You can also upload the video by using drag and drop features. After adding the video, you should proceed with the addition of the title and description. In case you also want to target the Facebook audience, you can make it visible there as well. For such a task, you can see a specific button that will allow you to do that as well.

These are basic procedures to upload videos on IGTV. After completing the procedure, you need to wait for a few minutes only. Here, the video uploading procedure will take time as per your internet speed and connection quality.

### Final Words
