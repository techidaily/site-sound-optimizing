Premiere Elements helps simplify the entire video-making process. Adding beats to the video is a simple task here. All you have to do is add the required audio file to the timeline and then make use of the beat detection. This adds markers to the entire track. The beat detection setting can be customized as per the requirement. The customization takes just a few moments.

**Review:** This feature can only be used in the expert view of the app only. The expert view app allows the user to add new markers just by punching the set bead maker option in the timeline.

#### 3\. [Splice](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725) **(Free, but offers in-app purchases)**

Splice is one of the best available options for video editing in case you record lots and lots of videos on your iPad and iPhone. The app showcases all the required features that are needed to edit the videos like a pro. This app also features other editing tools that help to make cuts in the videos or applying filters to them. Splice syncs videos to the beats automatically and also add the transitions wherever required to make the video experience smoother. The app features a huge royalty-free music library and also a built-in voice recorder.

**Review:** The free version of the app offers very limited options and the user has to subscribe to monthly or annual subscriptions to enjoy the rest.

### **Conclusion**

Making beats is of great importance, which can create magic when you work on a music video. Hopefully you may have a full understanding of how to make beats for your music videos after reading this article.

## Four Ways to Solve Audio Importing Issues in Adobe Premiere Pro

There are numerous factors that can cause Adobe Premiere Pro to [stop functioning properly](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2356540), and if the app won’t let you import video files into a project because it has no audio or video streams, there are few things you can do to fix this without having to reinstall the operating system on your computer or the version of Adobe Premiere Pro you’re currently using.

### [![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 1\. Clearing the Media File Cache

If you tried to import a video file into a project and the app notified you that it cannot import the file because there is no audio stream, you should head over to the **Edit menu** and select the **Preferences Tab.** Once the Preferences window pops up on the screen, click on the **Media tab** and then proceed to delete all files that are stored in the **Media Cache Database** and **Media Cache Files** folders. Restart the application after you’ve cleaned both of these folders and try to import the video clips into the project once more. If the issue persists, there are a few more things you can do.

![clear Media File Cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Clearing-Media-File-Cache-no-sound.jpg)

### 2\. Renaming the Media Cache Folder

The default location of Media Cache Database and Media Cache Files folders is **/Users/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common** on Mac computers and **\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common** on PC computers. So all you have to do is make sure that all Adobe applications, including the Adobe Premiere Pro, are closed and then go to the location at which these folders are stored and change their names to **Media Cache Files\_OLD** and **Media Cache\_OLD**. Start Adobe Premiere Pro and check if you can import your video files into the editor.

### 3\. Moving Media Files to a Different Folder

If renaming the folders didn’t do the trick you can try moving them from their default location. You can move them wherever you want on your computer, but it is best if you pick a location that is easy to remember, just so you can access them quickly in case you need to delete files that are stored in them.

### 4\. Installing the QuickTime Player

Sometimes the simplest solution is also the most effective one. Check if QuickTime is installed on your computer because installing this player can solve the audio importing issues in Adobe Premiere Pro. Furthermore, if you just reinstalled the OS on your computer, you should [download and install QuickTime](https://support.apple.com/quicktime), before launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you create a new project go to the **Edit menu**, find the **Preferences submenu and select the Media option**. Clean both the **Media Cache Database and Media Cache Files** folders, restart Adobe Premiere Pro and then import the video files into your project.

**Step 3: Import from Import Button**

The second method calls up users to import audio through a button. The user needs to tap on the "Import Media Files Here" button to add audio in Filmora directly.

**Step 4: Import by Drag and Drop**

Users can import audios on Filmora in another way. They can drag and drop the audio files directly on the platform and perform functions using different tools.
