The 3D lyrics video template is one of its kind as it contains two projects under one model.

The first version is straightforward where you get to learn the steps like

* how to edit texts

* how to render video in any resolution and fps

and quickly get started even by any amateur after effect user.

It allows you to change the background color, adjust controls like extrusion quality, etc. and ten other adjustment layers. Finally, render the video at a particular frame rate and resolution.
