Install and launch Video Editor and choose the "Import" button from the top menu. Then a browser window opens for you to navigate to the target video or audio file. Select the file you want and click the "Open" button. Then the file will be inserted into the library. You can also directly drag and drop the file to the program's library.

### Step 2: Add audio fade in effect to video

After that, drag and drop your video or audio file to the corresponding timelines. Double click on the target file and go to the "Audio" column. Then you'll see several settings such as Volume, Fade In, Fade Out and Pitch in the context menu. Find the "Fade In" option and drag the slider bar to the right or left to set the fade in length manually. After that, playback your video and adjust the fade in effect until you achieve the desired sound.
