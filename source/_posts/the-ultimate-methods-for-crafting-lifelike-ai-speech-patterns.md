### 7\. [PreSonus](https://www.presonus.com/)

Presonus can be considered an underdog in the world of hip-hop DAW, which has now started to pick up the pace and match the performance of high-end audio workstations like FL Studio. In the latest version, Presonus offers a variety of features like Harmonic Editing that’ll make your music production a hassle-free task. The latest version also majorly focuses on enhancing the workflow.

**Pros**

* Easy Workflow
* Perfect for Moderate Audio Mixing

**Cons**

### 8\. [Mixcraft Pro Studio](https://acoustica.com/mixcraft)

There are only a few digital audio workstations that offer a beginner-friendly interface. Fortunately, Acoustica Mixcraft Pro is one of them. With its sleek design, it’ll become quite easier to start composing your tracks, even if it’s your first time working on a DAW. The software also offers a decent amount of plugins that’ll help you add professional-touch to your tracks.

**Pros**

* Perfect for Beginners
* Enough Built-In plugins to start with music production

**Cons**

* Fewer software upgrades
* Not an ideal tool for advanced projects
