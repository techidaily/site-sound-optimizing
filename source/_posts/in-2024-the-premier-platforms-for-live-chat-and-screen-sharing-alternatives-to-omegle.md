It helps you chat through text messages and video calls with other users without letting them know your identity and personal information. It allows you to talk to random people throughout the world without the fear of being exposed or leaking your information.

## How to Add Audio to Video Easily

Now see the easy steps to add audio to video files or replace the original audio track with a new voiceover or music.

### Step 1: Add audio and video files to the program

After downloading and installing Wondershare Filmora, you can either click Import on the primary windows and select audio and video files from your computer or simply drag and drop audio and video files to the project media library. Filmora also features a free Audio Library, which provides different genres of music and sound effects.

### Step 2: Add a new audio file to the video

### Step 3: Record and add your voiceover to video

Instead of [adding music to the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can also record and add voiceover to the video. It's a fun way to add narration or complementary audio to video. To do so, click the Record button on the toolbar above timeline, the Record dialog will appear.

Click the red Record button, and you can start to talk in 3 seconds. The voiceover will be added to the User's Album and timeline when completed.

### Step 4: Replace audio track of the video

This is similar to adding audio to video. Just an extra step is required: delete the original audio file. To do so, right-click the video you want to replace audio in it, and select [Audio Detach](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). After that, delete the audio file from the track.

As described above, you can then drag and drop a new audio file from User's Album to the Audio track.
