![ Best Free Online Voice Changer:  Voice Changer.iO](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-io-online.jpg)

All you need to start a new audio recording session is a [microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)and a web browser, but you should keep in mind that the quality of the voice recording depends on your microphone.

Once you’ve completed the voice recording session you can choose from dozens of voice effects that can make you sound like an alien or a villain from a superhero movie.

![ Best Free Online Voice Changer: Voice-changer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-online-tool.jpg)

This online voice changer doesn’t let you adjust the [bit rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or any other audio recording setting, which makes it difficult to control the noise or the peak levels in the audio files you are creating. Additionally, Voice-changer features only a limited range of voice effects and it doesn’t offer much more than the standard options that make your voice sound robotic or like you were talking from a cave.

Furthermore, the Pitch Shifter tool only lets you [change the pitch of an audio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)file by using the Pitch Shift slider or inserting a new value into the box next to the Semitones option.

![Best Free Online Voice Changer: Online Tone Generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-voice-with-online-tone-generator.jpg)

You can’t choose the output file format, and all voice recordings you edit with this tool are going to be saved in the WAV file format.

### 7\. [Voice Spice Recorder](https://voicespice.com/)

You can record new audio or use the platform’s Text-to-Speech option to start the voice changing process, but uploading a file to Voice Spice Recorder from your computer isn’t available. The platform provides you with a basic set of audio recording settings that enable you to choose how loud your microphone will be or if you want to apply an effect like Hell Demon, Space Squirrel, or change the voice from male to male female.
