### 5\. Track and Maintain Audio Levels

This is a post-editing technique that involves the use of statistics to maintain audio. Many editing or recording tools feature audio levels. This will help in monitoring any high or low frequencies in videos. Later, they can manage noise by observing the audio levels.

## Bonus Part: Make Audio Editing Easy with Best-in-Class Audio Management Functionality - Wondershare Filmora

No doubt, the **Audacity denoise** feature is available for use, but it is difficult to access. Someone with primary editing skills cannot operate this software. Hence, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for denoising audio and elevating content. You can employ two of its features to remove background noises. With its [Audio Denoise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) feature, you can decrease various types of noise.

It can assist in audio enhancement and denoising wind noise, echoes, and hums. With its [AI Vocal Remover](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) feature, you can separate vocals from background noise. Both these features use AI technology to improve audio accuracy. Hence, it is your perfect replacement for **Audacity background noise**.
