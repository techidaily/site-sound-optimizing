After entering the Filmora main editing interface, click "Import" or drag and drop your video and voiceover file to the project library.

![import video footage to Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-import-media-interface.jpg)

Filmora video editing software supports a vast range of formats, so you do not have to convert the files before importing. When all the files are imported, drag and drop them to the Video Timeline.

#### 2\. Record Voiceover in Video Editing

If you're editng video and want to record voiceover in real time, you can also click the Record icon to start the recording.

Place the Playhead to the position where you need a voiceover, and then click the Microphone icon in the toolbar to start.

As before, the recorded voiceover will be added to the audio track automatically.

Note: To start a new record on the Timeline, you don't need to close the dialog, just move the Time Indicator to another position and record a new voiceover.

#### 3\. Edit voiceover and Export

Just like what we said before, you can then edit the recorded voiceover to fit the video perfectly and then export it to your computer or upload to YouTube directly.

Filmora features more audio editing tools for improving the sound. Below is a video tutorial for applying fade in and out transition in Filmora. Download the trial version to test yourself.
