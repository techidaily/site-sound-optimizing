Although the M4A is a famous type of audio format, there are still a lot of media players which do not support this kind of audio files. You will need to refer to M4A Player apps that support playing M4A if you want to enjoy it on your Android devices. Another solution to this issue is that you can convert the M4A files to commonly seen audio files with Filmora, such as MP3 which is supported by most, if not all kinds of Android players to enjoy it on your Android phones. Try it now.
