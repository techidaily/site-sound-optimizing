### **2\.** [**AI Music Generator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

In addition to extracting beats from songs and removing acapella, Filmora also allows you to generate music for your videos. The AI Music Generator feature will generate a musical masterpiece for you in seconds. You get to choose between different genres and styles. This AI feature also allows you to seamlessly edit your music creation on the go. Your videos become livelier and engaging to the viewers.

### **3\.** [**AI Copilot Editing**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Another useful feature on Filmora is AI Copilot Editing, which makes it easy for you to edit your audio and video. You only need to ask Filmora to perform a certain editing task, and it will do the rest of the work for you. This streamlines your editing process by offering real-time guidance and prevents common errors by detecting conflicting messages. The Copilot also optimizes your workflow by providing valuable AI insights and support on every step of video editing.

## **Conclusion**

When you want to extract beat from song, choosing good software will make the entire process easier. The methods shared here demonstrate how different tools can be used to separate vocals and beats in an audio file. Each uses a different approach and provides a certain quality level of output. However, we recommend Wondershare Filmora because of its phenomenal audio and editing features. In addition to extracting beats from your favorite songs, the software allows you to edit the files further for other purposes.
