### 7. [3D Lyrics](https://elements.envato.com/kinetic-typography-3d-lyrics-two-ae-projects-VDPC5G6)

The 3D lyrics video template is one of its kind as it contains two projects under one model.

The first version is straightforward where you get to learn the steps like

* how to edit texts
* how to add images/music/logo
* how to use controls
* how to render video in any resolution and fps

and quickly get started even by any amateur after effect user.

But, the second version is a little complicated. It is a detailed version of the first one where you learn how a project is organized and how you should customize it.

It also has tips on how to create previews during customization in the least possible time.

You need to arrange the scenes you wish to use in final composition, import the audio, and edit the first, second, and third scene’s text.

It allows you to change the background color, adjust controls like extrusion quality, etc. and ten other adjustment layers. Finally, render the video at a particular frame rate and resolution.
