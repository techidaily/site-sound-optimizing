You can use it to create videos with multiple effects, color corrections, stabilisations, and audio enhancements. It is easy for users to create cutaways, use blue/green screens, or apply split screens or picture-in-pictures.

An equalizer and an audio filter are built into the Mac version of iMovie to reduce noise. Make sure your setup does not remove the voice as well. In contrast, the iPhone requires the audio to be detachable or the volume to be reduced.

### The Step-by-Step Guide to Reducing Wind Noise in Videos

#### Step 1: Open iMovie and start a new project

Tap "Create Project" in iMovie on your iPhone. This is the first step toward making your video stand out.

#### Step 2: Select Your Video

From your photo library, select the video you want. Choosing a video is as simple as scrolling, tapping, and watching.

#### Step 3: Remove unwanted audio and delete it

Choose "Detach" on your video. Do you see that audio? Get rid of it. Turn the volume down or delete it - your choice. Say goodbye to background noise!

#### Step 4: Choose a sound to add

Your video will be spiced up with music or your amazing voiceover. Adding a soundtrack to your creation is like giving it its own soundtrack.

It's easy to remove noise from your iPhone movies and edit sound creatively with iMovie. You only need to tap a few times and your video will be ready to shine without any unwanted background audio.
