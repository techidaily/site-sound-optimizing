![install-audacity-via-ppa-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step2.png)

After you've added the Audacity package to the system's software sources, you'll need to update the package repository in order to get Audacity to work.

### Installing Audacity from the Snap Store

A version of Audacity is also available for download via the Snap shop. Using a Snap is among the quickest and most straightforward methods of installing any program since it takes into account all of the application's updates and dependencies. In order to install Audacity using Snap, you must first ensure that Snap is already installed on the Ubuntu system. Snap is pre-installed in the newest versions of Ubuntu and is available as a default. If Snap is not already installed on your system, you may do it by using the instructions shown below.

![install-audacity-snap-store-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-snap-store-step1.png)

## How to uninstall Audacity Ubuntu

For whatever reason, if you wish to remove the Audacity program from your computer, you may follow these instructions.

### Method 1

If you installed Audacity through the Snap method, execute the following command in your terminal: **$ sudo snap remove Audacity**

### Method 2

If you have installed the application using the PPA, you may remove it by performing the instructions shown below.

\>**Step** 1:

The first step is to

This indicates that the add-apt-repository command was used to add the PPA to your system. You may also use the same command to uninstall the PPA from your computer. Simply include the —remove option in your command.

**$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**

\>**Step** 2:

As of the right moment, the PPA has been withdrawn. What happens to the programs that are installed using these PPAs? Will they be eliminated as a consequence of the abolition of the Patriot Act? The answer is a resounding no.

Thus, PPA-purge enters the scene to help solve the problem. The PPA is disabled, but all of the apps installed by the PPA are also uninstalled, or they are reverted to the original versions given by your distribution.

Install the PPA-purge package and remove the Audacity package may be accomplished by running the following command.

**$ sudo apt install ppa-purge && sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**

### 3\. Music Maker

Magix is well known for a variety of music tech products: Music Maker, Samplitude, Acid Music Studio / Acid Pro, and Sound Forge. Music Maker is a Windows and Chromebook DAW built for beginners and hobbyists, rather than severe semi-pro or advanced consumers. It comes in 4 versions to have a range of apps to match your needs.

### 4\. BandLab

BandLab is a free browser DAW for Chromebook that you would expect to be a straightforward DAW. Bandlab DAW only works in Chrome, and your phone has a version. While other Digital Audio Workstation manufacturers are starting to incorporate some of the simple cloud functionality, BandLab is a DAW designed in the field.

**Features**

* There are some pretty high-shelf functions, such as tap-tempo, magnetic timeline, lyric editor, and tracking version.
* The sound is pretty basic, but again you cannot expect a 25 GB piano library to hold it against.
* You can create a 'band' with other users; everyone has access to the same set of songs, works together on songs, and even uses' fork.'

![8 DAW for Chromebook - BandLab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/bandlab-phone.JPG)

### 5\. Song Maker

Google started a free sequencer on the occasion of the Music In Our Schools Month: Chrome Music Lab's Song Maker. The idea is that everyone can create loops with up to two tools. Others can then share the loop.

**Features**

* This simple exercise is for notes to perform and for musical compositions to share.
* The midi trigger or machine keyboard functions and is web-based, so no installation is necessary.

## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.
