## Harmonizing Your Listening Experience: Levels of Loudness Control in VLC Player

## How To Normalize Volume in VLC

How to normalize volume, why should we do it, and what is it after all? – these are the questions when it comes to editing our audio files, as well as the video clips we tend to change the sound of. So, first of all, the volume normalization is pretty much explained as follows: The process when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, which is “the norm” for the project. If it is a little bit difficult to understand, we have to highlight that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.

But, why bother at all and why not leave it the way it is? Well, the answer to this is almost the same as on why editing exists in general, right? Things are not perfect! This is the fact that prompts us to make our video clips and audio better, improve it at least on the level which can get us the right amount of viewers and listeners. Everyone have had some pain listening to several podcasts, when the volume was too high or too low, or there were so much background noise that the whole recording was hurting the ears of a person! People will not convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners if their user experience is not favored. So, it is in our best interest to serve their best interest, with a little bit of editing.

When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.

In the first case, you might have somewhat quite voice recording, and would like to make it better without changing its dynamic range, while making it as loud as possible. And when it comes to matching volumes, it is logical that you need to manipulate your editing this way in case you have a group of audio files, each or some of them are at different volumes, so, understandably, if not necessarily, you would like to make them come closer to the same volume.

So, until we give you the step-by step guide on how to normalize your volume in VLC player, we also need to inform you about audio normalization types. Here, generally, we come across three of them: a so-called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; another is called loudness normalization and it adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness. Last but not least, RMS (Root-Mean-Square), changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.

Using any of this, making it better to listen to your voice, without people being annoyed and their ears becoming exhausting with what you have to offer, you will be making it enjoyable for them and easy to come back to your content, as they will not be obliged to change the volume on their own audio players. Instead, their experience with you will be calm and effortless, which you are aiming to achieve.

So, not, what about VLC? – this is a very popular media player, favorite for a lot of people all around the world, so you should already be quite familiar with what it is, at least by having streamed videos and movies there. Speaking more of what it represents, it is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It is worth noting that it can also play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC and additionally, the program can stream from popular websites such as Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and so on.

As if it was not enough, you can do simple video and audio editing in VLC Media Player, which a lot of people are unaware of! For example, you can easily trim and cut videos. So, as it happens, we can also normalize volume in VLC Media Player. It is a very handy feature and it works on Windows as well as on Mac. Sooo… How to do that? Because, actually, it is so simple that you might be surprised you didn’t know about this earlier. To learn how to normalize volume in VLC, follow this simple guideline:

First, of course, as every time working with any software, you need to have VLC Media Player installed on your device. Once you have it installed, open VLC. Go to the Tools and Preferences and there, you will need to check the single box which is next to Normalize volume in Effects. Now, set the level to the one that works best for you. Then, when you are happy with the result, you can Save.

This is not something perfect, because it’s so simple to do and actually what it does is just help adjust the general volume, so it leaves the specifics alone.

![help adjust general volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-1.jpg)

But, it might be the case that you are not so satisfied with the simple editing and want a little more to get from the editing process on VLC. So, you can do more with the Audio Effects menu there. And the steps are as follows:

First, on your VLC player, find Tools and then, in the menu, go to Preferences. The window will open, and there you need to select All in Show settings – actually it is a little bit hard to find because this is in the bottom left corner of the window. From there, you will need to navigate to Audio, and then, a little below, click on Filters and highlight it. The checkbox next to the Dynamic range compressor will probably be unchecked – so, check in it.

![find tools and go to preferences](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-2.jpg)

Next, see where Compressor is in the left panel? Select it. And now, you are free to make the changes to the levels as you see fit.

![see compressor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-3.jpg)

Here, if you are a little bit overwhelmed with the wide range of options to work on, you can just concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.

Don’t underestimate Attack time and release time, either. They graduate the changes to ramp them up at first, then down again, rather than initiating them immediately. So, if you set them to your liking as well, this will ensure that you have a more fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, sometimes scary volume changes.

Therefore, you are now equipped with the most information you will need to normalize volume in VLC Player – so free to give it a go, play around with the different settings and carry out the best result imaginable for you!

## Roles of a Director Department

The director is considered to be in charge of filmmaking. His main responsibility is creatively giving the idea to the production and communicating to the crew and characters to check out what they want in their scenes to play out.

The director department mainly consists of the director and the first assistant director, and sometimes there is a 2nd, a 3rd, and 4th AD. For example,

### 1st AD

The first lead is mainly in charge of time management, communicate with the crew member, and ensuring that the shorts get done safely and readily.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If there is no dialogue in the shorts, then the director usually gives reference pictures of the scenes and moods to act in that way.

You need to work with different people in the industry to check their personalities and work according to them. There is no need to work with the same people repeatedly.

## Team for Production Designing

The next and foremost department is the production design. In this the production designer is the leader of all and has to work with the art director. He is mainly in charge of the set builders, set dressers, prop makers, hair and makeup, and costume and wardrobe departments.

In this department, the production designer is mainly involved in decorating the sets, making props, and setting up the lighting.

## Director's monitor

The director's monitor is the screen that displays a live shoot and filming of everything happening on camera. It mainly gives each take's exact position and views for coordinating with the director and the DP.

Due to this, they can change the direction and the setup wherever they want and whenever they want.

![director monitor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/director-monitor.gif)

### Camera operators

To operate the camera, the DPs are not involved, but there is a specific job of the camera operators, which handle the shots and moves according to the director's directions. There are also 1st and 2nd Assistant Cameras (AC) with the camera operators.

**1st Assistant Camera**

The duty of the 1st AC is to focus on the required target, pulling, swapping the lenses from the camera. He is ensuring that the camera is all set and workable on the shoot day without any trouble.

**2nd Assistant Camera**

The 2nd AC has to consider the slates of the shots, place exact locations and markers for the characters, and give exposed footage to save for the backup.

### Gaffers and key grip

Gaffers and key grip have their own teams for maintaining the lighting and grip work assigned by the DP according to the creative plans.

### Digital media technician

It is essential to get the backup of footage of every shot. If you are working on a large scale, the backup planner is recognized as the Digital Media Technician (DMT).

DMT will handle the exposed footage, which Digital Memory Card will do with tapes denoting the card's number. Make sure to make two backups of the footage to prevent any trouble.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Making two copies for the backup will reduce the risk of corrupted files and physical accidents of losing the footage.

## Additional Roles

If you are the music video **director**, you need a **Cinematographer** with **Camera Operators**. He will be in charge of pulling and adjusting all the camera alignments. If you have enough budget, go with the **co-producer** to help you direct the talents.

To make your subject looks good and modern according to the theme, you should hire **hair and makeup artist.** If you have more budget, you can do it professionally with more and more crew members.

## Conclusion

If you are a starter, then there is no need to worry to pull-off all the roles in a crew; you just need two to three people for the start-up. That's all about the large production, but whenever you scale up, you should know how to manage all the members with their required areas.

You need to work with different people in the industry to check their personalities and work according to them. There is no need to work with the same people repeatedly.
