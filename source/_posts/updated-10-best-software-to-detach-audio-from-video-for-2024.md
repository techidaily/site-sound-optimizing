Here are some of the ways where you can download all kinds of sound effects that are free to use.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

As YouTube doesn’t allow downloading videos directly to your device all the time unless the video owner allow it, you need to use third party websites that allows users to convert YouTube videos into MP3 files. MP3FY is an awesome website that will allow you to download the audio part of the YouTube video that you want to download. Here is how you can do it.

**Step 1:** First you need to visit MP3FY website from your computer browser.

**Step 2:** Next you need to copy the video link from YouTube and paste the link into the box.

**Step 3:** Then click on the Convert button and click Confirm after that so that you can verify the video.

**Step 4:** Finally you need to click on the Download MP3 button to Save the MP3 file to your computer, where you can play it in your favorite music player or simply use it to add into any video of your choice.

![mp3fy web](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-3.png)

Another way to download audio from YouTube video is by converting a video to MP3 directly from YouTube. Here is how.

**Step 1:** First you need to add the letters fy between youtube and .com in the URL for the YouTube video you want to convert.

**Step 2:** This will take you to the MP3FY website, where you need to follow the same steps like before to convert and download the MP3 file.

### 2\. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself

If you have FL Studio and 3xOSC plugin then you can easily create bell sounds mp3 effect by yourself. The process is a bit technical but we’ll get you through this process step by step.

**Step 1:** First you need to load 3xOsc to your FL Studio project and choose Sine Wave as the shape for the Oscillator 1\. Also, for this process, we’ll only need ONE oscillator so disable the Osc 2 & Osc 3 by turning their volume levels to 0%.

![load 3xosc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-6.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).

![vol subtab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant

![tns button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-8.jpg)

**Step 4:** Finally, you need to add that spacious depth and color to the sound via Fruity Reeverb. So, you can assign the 3xOsc to a free mixer track and drop a Fruity Reeverb to its effect slot. You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.
