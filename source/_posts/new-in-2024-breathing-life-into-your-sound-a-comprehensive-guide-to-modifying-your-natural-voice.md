Naturally, a person’s voice changes with time. Although time is not only the reason, the environment also plays an essential role in changing voice.

![factors making sound unique](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-your-voice-1.jpg)

### 1\. Gender

Females have small vocal cords as compared to males since birth. Then at puberty, the rise in the testosterone level causes the larynx to enlarge, and that changes your voice. Over time, the vocal cords thicken and tighten, which creates a vibration in sound along with deeper resonance. For females, the cords do not get tight, which results in a high pitch in the female voice.

### 2\. Structure of Anomalies

The structure of anomalies is referred to as cleft palates deviated spectrum. Anomalies affect the clearness that is in a person's voice. The structure of one's voice can be altered by the age, overall health, cleanliness, and emotional state of a person. Alongside the texture of sound, pitch and timbre can also change your voice.

### 3\. Body Structure

Bodyweight plays a vital role in changing voice. Obese men produce excessive estrogen that causes a rise in their voices. On the contrary, obese women have excessive testosterone that makes their voice deeper than others. Being obese makes the breath control better that results in generating a raspy sound.

### 4\. Height

Underweight people have less endurance which increases the chance of injury to vocal cords. In comparison, heightened people have comparatively bigger lungs and larger lower airways, causing them to produce deeper voices compared to short people.

### 5\. Heredity

Heredity and genetics play an important role in shaping your voice as it is a part of your anatomy too. Genetics is why you might find people from the same family have similar voices. Sound is made by the vocal cords that are in the larynx. The larynx is given a genetic code, which alters itself over time. These alterations, as a reaction, change your voice.

## Part 2\. How to Change Your Voice in Practice?

There are multiple reasons why someone wants to change their voice. Someone might not be satisfied with their low pitch voice or want to have a deeper voice. At the same time, you might also want to change your voice to any frictional character. Or you might want to change your voice to Morgan freeman too.

The real question is ‘Can you change your voice?’. Yes, it is possible. There are a lot of ways to do it, but they differ in complexity and effectiveness. You can either use any voice changer, or else you can also choose the natural way, which is a long-term approach. A few ways to change your voice in practice are discussed below:

### Change the Way you Talk

Expressions change the emotions that affect the voice. Nasal and non-nasal voices differ as the nasal voices have a higher pitch as compared to non-nasal sounds. Changing the accent also affects the voice. The voice apparently stays the same, but the hearings of words change to make others feel the change of voice—for example, American and British accents.

### Taking Care of Vocal Cords

Taking care of vocal cords can help change your voice. Smoking causes loss of voice and lowers the range of voice. Screaming can damage the vocal cords that automatically affects the voice. Breathing in polluted air not only changes the voice but also damages the vocal cords.

### Vocal Exercises

There are some exercises that relax the vocal cords. These exercises include massaging the throat to loosen tense muscles, humming, taking deep breaths. Another exercise is loosening the jaw by opening it wide and closing it gently. Lip buzzing, yawning, and tongue trills are also considered exercises for vocal cords that can change your voice.

01 [What Should Be Considered Before Choose a Sound Editor?](#part1)

02 [5 Recommended Best Sound Editor in 2024](#part2)

## Part 1\. What Should Be Considered Before Choose a Sound Editor?

There are various sound editors available. We are here to help you by sharing different factors that should be considered to select a better sound editing app. Let’s start!

### 1\. Recording Options and Supported Channels

What kind of recording options are needed? If you can record from external devices, nothing is better than that. Moving on, the number of supported channels also matters a lot. This is because not every Podcast will take three or four tracks.

### 2\. Plugins and Add On

While selecting your sound editing app, check its behavior with other apps. This is because editing software expands with additional features, sounds, and other plugins and add-ons. Some of these are free, whereas some are costly.

### 3\. Operating System and Pricing

One important thing that should be checked is your device’s compatibility with the sound editor. What so ever device and operating system you use, make sure it works with your device. Lastly, remember one thing, editing like professionals do not require tons of money. It's essential that you wisely select an affordable editor.

### 4\. Editing Features

A sound editor should contain a mixture of basic and advanced editing features across its platform. It should include features such as the ones provided as follows:

* Audio Tracks: A good sound editor should at least support playing three audio tracks simultaneously in addition to the sound of the main audio track.
* Volume Control: Apart from this, an ideal sound editing software should also enable volume control for different parts of the video project.
* Normalization: Among the different features, one very noticeable feature that sound editing apps must have is Normalization. The feature automatically adjusts all the different volume levels of various sounds into balance.
* Auto Music: Auto music is the next editing feature we are going to share. This feature helps to make the length of the stock library audio according to your project length.
* Noise Filter: What do you think about noise filters? They are essential as in case of any recording that has background noise; these filters can do the magic.

### 5\. Export Audio

The audio editor should provide you with the option of changing the file format of the audio to any other supported audio format. The variety should be wide, which provides users with different opportunities to work across while exporting the audio.

## Part 2\. 5 Recommended Best Sound Editor in 2024

If the waveforms don't appear, go to the "view" drop-down menu and select "show waveforms", the waveform would show you the sound intensity level of a sound clip and definitely would give you an idea of what part will need to be turned up or down.

* **Audio Adjustments**

The audio editing window also contains primary noise reduction and audio equalization tools and a range of effects – from robot to echo- which would affect how people sound in your video.

iMovie permits you to adjust the audio within the clips themselves, each volume as a bar. You can shift up and down to increase or decrease the audio level. The clips also have "fade in" and "fade out" buttons at the beginning and end, which are draggable to adjust the fade length.

* **Audio Adjustments**

With the audio button situated at the top right, you have access to some essential audio editing tools for changing the sound level of your chosen clip or changing the relative volume of other films in the project.

The audio editing window also contains primary noise reduction and audio equalization tools and a range of effects – from robot to echo- which would affect how people sound in your video.

* **Editing Audio with the Timeline**

iMovie permits you to adjust the audio within the clips themselves, each volume as a bar. You can shift up and down to increase or decrease the audio level. The clips also have "fade in" and "fade out" buttons at the beginning and end, which are draggable to adjust the fade length.

## Conclusion

Finally, with the answers to the question, how to cut audio in iMovie, you can follow the simple step guide and feel free to edit your audio or video to your taste using iMovie or Wondershare Filmora.
