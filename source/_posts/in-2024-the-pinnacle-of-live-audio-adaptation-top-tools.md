 When **editing a video QuickTime MOV file**, sometimes you may need to[remove audio tracks](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) bundled with it so that you can add a different audio track. Although a range of video editing programs can help you achieve this, I think [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is worth trying. This program is cross-platform so that it can help you remove audio completely from the original MOV files with ease in **both Windows and Mac.**
