Just as you can probably guess by its name, iMovie is a video editor made by Apple which is available on almost all of its devices. This means that you can have a similar editing experience on your iPhone, iPad, iMac, and more. While this software is not ideal for any kind of advanced and large scale video editing projects, it is certainly more than enough for adding music to video files. Despite lacking video effects or other advanced features, you do get basic options like trimming, cutting, cropping, adding music, adding text, and other basic yet important features. Hence, if you want to learn how can I put music over a video on any of your Apple devices for completely free, then you can go through these steps and instructions:

When compared with other video editors out there, Premiere Pro by Adobe is used for all kinds of large scale products including Hollywood movies and TV shows. This is due to the reason that Adobe Premiere offers every possible feature that you can ever want in a video editor. Even though Adobe Premiere Pro is not free to use, it is still a great option for many users who want to edit videos more than just adding music files. Whether it is advanced video effects, plugins support, automated editing, extensive media support, color grading options, VFX support, compatibility with other Adobe tools, sound design, or anything else, Adobe Premiere Pro offers it all.

![ online editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/music-editor-1.png)

In case you just want to add music to video files without using or applying any more effects, then you don’t need to install any programs on your computer. Instead, you can use one of the various online video editors for putting music over videos. Such video editors are completely free and do not use your computer’s processor which makes them great for entry level computers which cannot run heavy video editing programs. Most of these online video editors are also quite easy to use with basic and simple user interfaces making them great for beginners. You can also put music over videos online using such video editors by going through this step by step guide:

### #5) How to Put Music in Kinemaster?

![kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/video-app-4.jpg)

While all the various video editor apps given above are great for easily adding music to videos, all of them require you to have a computer for using them. Unfortunately, not everyone has a computer which means that using the methods stated earlier might not be feasible. Thankfully, you can still put music on video files using your smartphone. This is made possible thanks to various video editors available for mobile devices out there. One such great video editor option that you can use on your mobile device is Kinemaster. Not only can it be used for adding music, but you can also use multiple video effects, add video layers, add text and images, use an inbuilt media library, and so much more.

● You can simply click on the Audio button to import any music file that you want to add to your video.
