## Editing Basics that Beginners’ Should Keep in Mind

The list below is the critical podcast editing basics a beginner should follow before publishing the podcast. Overall, it would be awesome if you learn new skills instead of outsourcing the whole stuff. That’s fantastic as well!

**Firstly, import the audio.**

The editing process starts with importing the audio track. The audio material in the sequence must be at the primary place. Always place the audio track in the first position even if you are importing multiple audio tracks. You can leave the track underneath for editing purposes. After adding this first audio file, you can add sound effects, music, and other secondary audio files for further editing.

**Listen again**

Don’t proceed before re-listening your added audio! This manner will let you think for different sections, and you can further decide what to keep and what to preserve. Remove any computer noise, background hiss, and unwanted audio areas. Here, you can help with different noise reduction tools available or go for the reliable podcast editing software, specifically the audio ducking feature for noise removal.

**Make it consistent throughout**

The next step is to make the volume consistent at every stage of the podcast. After removing all the unwanted noises, take the necessary action to normalize the audio levels and specifically select -2.0 for peak amplitude. Amplify the tranquil areas.

**Sound Designing and Mixing**

Then, you are required to do sound designing and mixing for the podcast. Take it lightly and only especially when you are a beginner. Add the sound effects as per the message of the podcast. Always keep in mind to use significant sound effects that effectively evoke the emotion and ultimately save the audience engaged. The mixing part comes when you compress, equalize, and process the audio to adjust accordingly in the different sections.

**Preview and Post**

Once your podcast is edited and ready, preview it ensure everything is in place, especially if it is your first time. It would be best to post a clear, concise, and to the point audio/video. Finally, post your podcast, either for free or using one of the software available online on your desired blog/online media.

## Which DAW should you use?

## Advanced Editing Tips to Spice Up Your Podcasts

Don't miss out on this portion if you want to upgrade your podcasting skills like professionals! Learn some advanced formulas of podcast audio editing as follows.

**Trim the Ends**

It's better if you trim the ends before editing the podcast. And, make sure there are no blanks at the beginning or end of the podcast. You can also add fade-in or fade-out effects to avoid unprofessional vibes.

**Work on your planning and presentation skills**

Focus on having a time-saving podcast editing by working upon your planning and presentation skills. Don’t be that guy who tries to edit every verbal crutch. Instead, focus on being confident while presenting the podcast so that you will need to have significantly fewer editing issues or may not need editing at all. Think upon changing the approach of podcast recording as well.

**Provide margin and look for transitions**

Offer a little margin and say that thing smoothly again if you have misread or misspell the statement while recording the podcast. Thus, you must not squeeze the information that doesn't provide a better room for podcast editing. The provided margin will make it a breeze to cut out the messy audio portion.

Then, you have to look for transitions precisely when you are recording in multiple tracks, co-hosting, or taking a long space while recording your podcast. These transitions could be like pointless babbles, awkward silences, cross talks, etc., that need careful watch at both the beginning and the end. Most of the editing will improve by considering and editing these kinds of transitions.

**Eliminate awkward silences**

Sometimes a podcast is full of awkward silences that look crap at all. Well, you don’t have to remove every silence taken at the end of a talk or something like that. Eliminate only long, awkward silences or reduce their duration. Different plugins are available within the DAWs to remove these background noises and long duration silences.

**Adjust the volume of the podcast**

It may be a bit tricky to edit the podcast when one person or interviewee is a lot quieter. First of all, check if their microphone signals and settings are strong enough to provide you with audio. Then, you can increase the gain of their speaker before podcast editing. Normalize the voice or add some compression to increase the loudness ultimately.

**Save podcast to the right format**

Finally, you must be careful while exporting your podcast to the correct format to ensure the best quality. Go to the export settings and find MP3 extension and 192kbps bitrate.

## Edit Podcast with Video Editor

## Advanced Editing Tips to Spice Up Your Podcasts

Don't miss out on this portion if you want to upgrade your podcasting skills like professionals! Learn some advanced formulas of podcast audio editing as follows.

**Trim the Ends**

It's better if you trim the ends before editing the podcast. And, make sure there are no blanks at the beginning or end of the podcast. You can also add fade-in or fade-out effects to avoid unprofessional vibes.

**Work on your planning and presentation skills**

Focus on having a time-saving podcast editing by working upon your planning and presentation skills. Don’t be that guy who tries to edit every verbal crutch. Instead, focus on being confident while presenting the podcast so that you will need to have significantly fewer editing issues or may not need editing at all. Think upon changing the approach of podcast recording as well.

**Provide margin and look for transitions**

Offer a little margin and say that thing smoothly again if you have misread or misspell the statement while recording the podcast. Thus, you must not squeeze the information that doesn't provide a better room for podcast editing. The provided margin will make it a breeze to cut out the messy audio portion.

Then, you have to look for transitions precisely when you are recording in multiple tracks, co-hosting, or taking a long space while recording your podcast. These transitions could be like pointless babbles, awkward silences, cross talks, etc., that need careful watch at both the beginning and the end. Most of the editing will improve by considering and editing these kinds of transitions.

**Eliminate awkward silences**

Sometimes a podcast is full of awkward silences that look crap at all. Well, you don’t have to remove every silence taken at the end of a talk or something like that. Eliminate only long, awkward silences or reduce their duration. Different plugins are available within the DAWs to remove these background noises and long duration silences.

**Adjust the volume of the podcast**

It may be a bit tricky to edit the podcast when one person or interviewee is a lot quieter. First of all, check if their microphone signals and settings are strong enough to provide you with audio. Then, you can increase the gain of their speaker before podcast editing. Normalize the voice or add some compression to increase the loudness ultimately.

**Save podcast to the right format**

Finally, you must be careful while exporting your podcast to the correct format to ensure the best quality. Go to the export settings and find MP3 extension and 192kbps bitrate.

## Edit Podcast with Video Editor

Are you recording a video podcast? If yes, you must make very little room for editing while considering the best recording equipment and settings. Secondly, you can look for a high-tech video editor that can do the task of both video editing and podcast editing. The Wondershare Filmora X is one such famous name in the world of video editing.

## 6 Ways to Remove Audio from Video Online in 2022

Each of the online tools presented in this article has a video size limit, which is why you need to make sure that the video file doesn’t exceed the size limit set by the platform. Furthermore, how long the upload is going to last depends on the size of the file, so it is advisable to choose a video that is small in size in order to avoid wasting a lot of time on waiting for the file to upload. Here’s how you can remove audio from videos online.

#### 2. [AudioRemover](https://www.audioremover.com/)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audioremover-online-audio-remover.jpg)

This platform offers a lot of video and audio editing tools for free, and it enables you to stabilize videos, change their size or to extract audio from video. The AudioRemover tool is quite simple to use, as you just have to click on the **Browse button** to select the video you’d like to upload and then click on the **Upload Video button** to start removing the audio from video. The entire process is automatic, so once the upload is over you can just click on the **Download File link** to save the new file to your computer. You can’t upload files larger than **500MB** to AudioRemover which can potentially reduce the number of options you have at your disposal. The platform replaces the entire audio of a video clip and it doesn’t allow you to remove only a part of the video’s original sound.

#### 3. [Audio-Extractor](http://audio-extractor.net/)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-extractor-online-audio-remover.jpg)

If you would like to separate the audio from a video, the Audio-Extractor tool is one of the best options available on the Internet. You just have to **upload a video file** to the platform from your computer or from the Google Drive, **select MP3, FLAC or OGG** output audio format and click on the **Extract Audio button**. You can then save the audio file on **Google Drive, Dropbox** or download it to your computer. The 123apps platform also offers Audio Cutter, Audio Converter and Voice Recorder tools you can use to edit an audio file online or add narration to your videos. However, Audio-Extractor isn’t the best option for removing audio from videos, since it only allows you to save audio files, which means that you can’t create a video that doesn’t contain sound with this tool.

#### 4. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/mute-video)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-remove-audio-from-video.jpg)

Kapwing is an online video editing platform that lets you add text or music to videos, change the playback speed of a video or create memes and stop-motion animations. The Mute Video tool reduces the video’s audio volume to zero automatically, which for all practical purposes is the same as removing an audio file from a video. After you upload a video to the platform, you’ll be able to preview it without sound, and if you like the result you can click on the **Create button**. Generating a muted file can take a while, depending on how long is the video, but once the process is completed, you can click on the **Download button** to save the video to your computer or the **Edit button** if you want to go through all the steps of muting a video again. All tools on the Kapwing platform are free, but the **videos you mute will be watermarked** unless you pay a small fee to remove the watermark.

#### 5. [Remove Sound From Videos Online](http://removesoundfromvideosonline.blogspot.com/)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/removesoundfromvideosonline.jpg)

The wide range of supported audio and video formats make this platform a reliable option for anyone who wants to extract an audio file from a video or remove the original audio from the video completely. Click on the **Choose File button** and then select either **Remove Sound or Extract Sound** option. If you want to **Extract Sound** the platform lets you choose from **MP3, iPhone ringtone or wav** output audio file formats. Click on the **Upload&Convert** button and wait for the video file to be processed. When the file is converted you can save the new video or audio file to a destination on your hard drive. However, the platform requests your **mobile phone number** before you can download a file and it **displays ads** after you click on the **Download button**, which can be quite frustrating if you want to remove audio from a video clip quickly.

#### 6. Using [YouTube](https://youtube.com) to Remove Audio From Videos

Although YouTube is not famous for its video or audio editing tools, you can still remove audio from videos in the platform’s **Creator Studio**. Select the video you’d like to mute and then go the **Creator Studio’s Video tab**. Once the options Video tab has to offer are displayed on the screen you should click on the **Audio tab**, that is located at the top of the screen next to **Enhancements and End Screen and Annotations tabs**. When the new tab opens you’ll notice that there is no option to remove audio from a video, but you can change the **Featured Tracks** option to **Ambient** and then select one of the available tracks in the menu below. The **Favor Original Audio** slider that is located below the preview window lets you control how much the new track is going to impact the video’s original sound. **Drag the slider all the way to the right** in order to avoid bringing back the original audio and then click on **the Position Audio option** to gain access to **the audio waveform**. **Drag the slider located on the right side of the waveform all the way to the left to trim the duration of the new audio to approximately one second** and the video will no longer have sound. **This audio editing technique won’t work if you trim the new audio to zero**, which is why it is important to **carefully set the duration of the new audio track** you added to the video. Click on the **Save as New Video option** to confirm the changes you’ve made and that’s it you successfully used YouTube to remove audio from a video.

**Conclusion**

Extracting or muting a video online is easy since you just have to upload a video file and the online tool you’ve chosen for this task will do the rest for you. The only downside is that you have to mute the entire video since none of the platforms featured in this article allows you to choose the section of a video you’d like to mute. Which method of removing audio from videos do you like to use the most? Leave a comment and let us know.

You can’t upload files larger than **500MB** to AudioRemover which can potentially reduce the number of options you have at your disposal. The platform replaces the entire audio of a video clip and it doesn’t allow you to remove only a part of the video’s original sound.

#### 3. [Audio-Extractor](http://audio-extractor.net/)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-extractor-online-audio-remover.jpg)

If you would like to separate the audio from a video, the Audio-Extractor tool is one of the best options available on the Internet. You just have to **upload a video file** to the platform from your computer or from the Google Drive, **select MP3, FLAC or OGG** output audio format and click on the **Extract Audio button**. You can then save the audio file on **Google Drive, Dropbox** or download it to your computer. The 123apps platform also offers Audio Cutter, Audio Converter and Voice Recorder tools you can use to edit an audio file online or add narration to your videos. However, Audio-Extractor isn’t the best option for removing audio from videos, since it only allows you to save audio files, which means that you can’t create a video that doesn’t contain sound with this tool.

#### 4. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/mute-video)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-remove-audio-from-video.jpg)

Kapwing is an online video editing platform that lets you add text or music to videos, change the playback speed of a video or create memes and stop-motion animations. The Mute Video tool reduces the video’s audio volume to zero automatically, which for all practical purposes is the same as removing an audio file from a video. After you upload a video to the platform, you’ll be able to preview it without sound, and if you like the result you can click on the **Create button**. Generating a muted file can take a while, depending on how long is the video, but once the process is completed, you can click on the **Download button** to save the video to your computer or the **Edit button** if you want to go through all the steps of muting a video again. All tools on the Kapwing platform are free, but the **videos you mute will be watermarked** unless you pay a small fee to remove the watermark.

#### 5. [Remove Sound From Videos Online](http://removesoundfromvideosonline.blogspot.com/)

![online audio remover.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/removesoundfromvideosonline.jpg)

The wide range of supported audio and video formats make this platform a reliable option for anyone who wants to extract an audio file from a video or remove the original audio from the video completely. Click on the **Choose File button** and then select either **Remove Sound or Extract Sound** option. If you want to **Extract Sound** the platform lets you choose from **MP3, iPhone ringtone or wav** output audio file formats. Click on the **Upload&Convert** button and wait for the video file to be processed. When the file is converted you can save the new video or audio file to a destination on your hard drive. However, the platform requests your **mobile phone number** before you can download a file and it **displays ads** after you click on the **Download button**, which can be quite frustrating if you want to remove audio from a video clip quickly.

#### 6. Using [YouTube](https://youtube.com) to Remove Audio From Videos

Although YouTube is not famous for its video or audio editing tools, you can still remove audio from videos in the platform’s **Creator Studio**. Select the video you’d like to mute and then go the **Creator Studio’s Video tab**. Once the options Video tab has to offer are displayed on the screen you should click on the **Audio tab**, that is located at the top of the screen next to **Enhancements and End Screen and Annotations tabs**. When the new tab opens you’ll notice that there is no option to remove audio from a video, but you can change the **Featured Tracks** option to **Ambient** and then select one of the available tracks in the menu below. The **Favor Original Audio** slider that is located below the preview window lets you control how much the new track is going to impact the video’s original sound. **Drag the slider all the way to the right** in order to avoid bringing back the original audio and then click on **the Position Audio option** to gain access to **the audio waveform**. **Drag the slider located on the right side of the waveform all the way to the left to trim the duration of the new audio to approximately one second** and the video will no longer have sound. **This audio editing technique won’t work if you trim the new audio to zero**, which is why it is important to **carefully set the duration of the new audio track** you added to the video. Click on the **Save as New Video option** to confirm the changes you’ve made and that’s it you successfully used YouTube to remove audio from a video.

**Conclusion**

Extracting or muting a video online is easy since you just have to upload a video file and the online tool you’ve chosen for this task will do the rest for you. The only downside is that you have to mute the entire video since none of the platforms featured in this article allows you to choose the section of a video you’d like to mute. Which method of removing audio from videos do you like to use the most? Leave a comment and let us know.

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twistedwave-online-audio-reverser.jpg)

Even though the TwistedWave Online Audio Editor can be used free of charge, you **must create an account in order to save the files you create**. And the free plan has limited features in file length and audio editing features. The online audio editor enables you to **record new audio files or to edit the existing ones**. Audio clips **can be imported from your computer, the Soundcloud platform or Google Drive.** After you upload a file to the TwistedWave, the editor window will display the file on its timeline as a waveform. Clicking on the **Effects** menu and selecting the **Reverse** option will play the file you uploaded backwards. Selecting the **Download** option in the File menu will give you the access to the **Audio Export** window where you can adjust the file’s properties before saving it to your computer.

## Best Audio Editing Software to Reverse Audio

At the moment there a lot of free audio editing software options available on the market which are powerful enough to enable you to reverse all sorts of audio files. We recommend using the [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) software to reverse your audio files. This **free, open source and cross-platform** software had 62.5 million downloads as of September 2018, which speaks volumes about its audio editing potential.

The software is **compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems**, and it offers a quick and easy way to **reverse an audio file**. After you’ve installed and launched the software, you just have to import the file, by selecting the Audio option, from the Import submenu that can be accessed from the software’s File menu. Alternatively, you can use the Ctrl+Shift+I keyboard shortcut to select the file you’d like to import into the software.

The file will be displayed as a waveform and placed on the software’s timeline. You can then proceed to **select the portion of the file you’d like to reverse** by holding the left mouse button while dragging the mouse cursor between any two points within the file. Use the Ctrl+A shortcut to select the entire file or head over to the Edit menu, click on the Select option and **choose All** from the submenu.

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-reverse-audio.jpg)

The software will reverse the highlighted portion of the file and you can listen to the results by clicking on the Play button. The **Export Audio** option that is available in the File menu lets you save the reversed audio to a chosen destination on your hard drive.

## Best Audio Reverser Apps for iOS and Android

Listening to reversed versions of your favorite songs on your Smartphone can be a lot of fun, so if you would like to explore the possibilities of reversing audio directly from an iPhone or Android device you should check out these apps.

#### 1. [Reverse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hipxel.audio.reverse.music.audio.player&hl=en%5FUS)

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-music-player-android-audio-reverser.jpg)

The Reverse Music Player is an Android-based app that lets you reverse sounds or music with ease. What’s more, you can make a song’s tempo up to 4 times faster or slower or adjust its Pitch. The app supports wav, mp3, ogg and flac audio file formats, but if you are using a large audio file reversing a song may take some time. A three-minute song can temporarily take up to 20MB of storage space on your phone’s memory card, while longer songs may take even more, so it is important to make sure that you have enough free space on your phone before you start using this app.

#### 2. [Reverse Audio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reverse-audio/id1254981556?mt=8)

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-audio-ios-audio-reverser.jpg)

iPhone users can reverse audio files they record with this app in just a few simple steps. The app lets you record an audio file and then it automatically plays the recording backwards. While you’re playing the audio, you can alter the Playback Rate or the Pitch. The Reverse Audio app also enables you to import audio files from other apps via the Share option, but audio files cannot be directly imported into the app. The limited amount of audio editing options makes this iOS-based app a moderately reliable choice for reversing audio files.

**Conclusion**

Playing songs or audio effects backwards can have unexpected results, which makes the process of reversing audio incredibly entertaining. These free and easy to use audio reversers can help you create high-quality sound effects that might make the videos you used them for, go viral. What is your favorite method of reversing audio files? Leave a comment below and let us know.

In order to reverse a song or an audio effect, you just have to click on the **Choose File** button to select the file and hit the **Reverse It** button to start reversing the audio file. Once the process is completed, you can save the file to a destination on your hard drive by clicking on the **Download** button.

Even though the TwistedWave Online Audio Editor can be used free of charge, you **must create an account in order to save the files you create**. And the free plan has limited features in file length and audio editing features. The online audio editor enables you to **record new audio files or to edit the existing ones**. Audio clips **can be imported from your computer, the Soundcloud platform or Google Drive.** After you upload a file to the TwistedWave, the editor window will display the file on its timeline as a waveform. Clicking on the **Effects** menu and selecting the **Reverse** option will play the file you uploaded backwards. Selecting the **Download** option in the File menu will give you the access to the **Audio Export** window where you can adjust the file’s properties before saving it to your computer.

## Best Audio Editing Software to Reverse Audio

At the moment there a lot of free audio editing software options available on the market which are powerful enough to enable you to reverse all sorts of audio files. We recommend using the [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) software to reverse your audio files. This **free, open source and cross-platform** software had 62.5 million downloads as of September 2018, which speaks volumes about its audio editing potential.

The software is **compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems**, and it offers a quick and easy way to **reverse an audio file**. After you’ve installed and launched the software, you just have to import the file, by selecting the Audio option, from the Import submenu that can be accessed from the software’s File menu. Alternatively, you can use the Ctrl+Shift+I keyboard shortcut to select the file you’d like to import into the software.

The file will be displayed as a waveform and placed on the software’s timeline. You can then proceed to **select the portion of the file you’d like to reverse** by holding the left mouse button while dragging the mouse cursor between any two points within the file. Use the Ctrl+A shortcut to select the entire file or head over to the Edit menu, click on the Select option and **choose All** from the submenu.

Once you’ve made sure that you properly selected the portion of the file you’d like to reverse, you should go to the **Effects** menu and click on the **Reverse** feature. The software will reverse the highlighted portion of the file and you can listen to the results by clicking on the Play button. The **Export Audio** option that is available in the File menu lets you save the reversed audio to a chosen destination on your hard drive.

## Best Audio Reverser Apps for iOS and Android

Listening to reversed versions of your favorite songs on your Smartphone can be a lot of fun, so if you would like to explore the possibilities of reversing audio directly from an iPhone or Android device you should check out these apps.

#### 1. [Reverse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hipxel.audio.reverse.music.audio.player&hl=en%5FUS)

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-music-player-android-audio-reverser.jpg)

The Reverse Music Player is an Android-based app that lets you reverse sounds or music with ease. What’s more, you can make a song’s tempo up to 4 times faster or slower or adjust its Pitch. The app supports wav, mp3, ogg and flac audio file formats, but if you are using a large audio file reversing a song may take some time. A three-minute song can temporarily take up to 20MB of storage space on your phone’s memory card, while longer songs may take even more, so it is important to make sure that you have enough free space on your phone before you start using this app.

#### 2. [Reverse Audio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reverse-audio/id1254981556?mt=8)

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-audio-ios-audio-reverser.jpg)

iPhone users can reverse audio files they record with this app in just a few simple steps. The app lets you record an audio file and then it automatically plays the recording backwards. While you’re playing the audio, you can alter the Playback Rate or the Pitch. The Reverse Audio app also enables you to import audio files from other apps via the Share option, but audio files cannot be directly imported into the app. The limited amount of audio editing options makes this iOS-based app a moderately reliable choice for reversing audio files.

**Conclusion**

Playing songs or audio effects backwards can have unexpected results, which makes the process of reversing audio incredibly entertaining. These free and easy to use audio reversers can help you create high-quality sound effects that might make the videos you used them for, go viral. What is your favorite method of reversing audio files? Leave a comment below and let us know.
