You can also convert the text-to-speech audio into MP3, MP4, or WAV files and download them with this application. You can register for the free voice over generator version of VoiceOverMaker on their website. But this version will allow you to convert only 800 characters. If you want a voice over for more than that, you must purchase the software. There are three different paid versions - Standard, Medium, and Large - you can choose one that suits your needs.
