**Step #2\.** Then, choose **AUDIO**.

You will now be given three options. Soundtracks, My Music, and Songs in iCloud. Make your choice.

To listen to a soundtrack, tap it. If a soundtrack is muted, press it to download it first, and then hit it again to preview it.

**Adding sound effects**

When you add a sound effect, it is linked to the video clip above it in the timeline. When you move the video clip, the sound effect moves with it. This differs from soundtracks, which are separate from the video segments in your production.

Scroll the timeline with your project open until the play head (the white vertical line) appears where you wish to add the sound effect.

To browse the built-in sound effects, press the **Add Media** button, then **Audio**, then **Sound Effects**.

To hear a sound effect, tap it.

Tap the **Add Audio** button next to the sound effect to add it.

**Step #4\.** Adjust the volume of the clip

After you've added sound to your iMovie project, you may change the level of audio clips to achieve the ideal sound mix, or change the level of video clips that have sound. To change the volume of an audio or video clip, select it in the timeline, click the **Volume** button at the bottom of the window, and then drag the slider to raise or decrease the volume. When you completely reduce the volume of a clip, a **Mute** symbol displays on the clip in the timeline.

**Step #3\.** Drag jingles or other audio clips to the music well, represented by the musical note icon in the timeline, to create background music for your film. The video clips in the timeline have no effect on the audio in the music well.
