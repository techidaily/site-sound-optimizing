## Part 1: How to Record Voice/Audio on Samsung S10/S9?

The Samsung S10/S9 comes up with an in-built voice recorder app that handles all the recording-related concerns. A Samsung user, most probably, S10/S9 user, understands the workability of the voice recorder and its three modes. However, if you plan to buy S10/S9 to address your voice recording concerns, how about we give you a guided tour?

The article presents guidelines for how to record audio on Samsung S9 and how to record audio on Samsung S10\. Let us begin!

### Step 1: Launching the Voice Recording App

For starters, launch the Voice Recording app from your Samsung S10/S9\. The tool offers you three modes to select based on your audio preferences.

### Step 2: Standard Mode

The first mode is "Standard." It is considered a simple and fast voice recording. To use the "Standard" mode, perform the following steps.

* Click on "Standard" and then hit the "Record" button located at the bottom of the screen.

### Step 3: Interview Mode

The next mode is the "Interview" mode. This mode makes use of two microphones, which are connected at each end of the phone. The mode works like a charm when you are expected to record a conversational interview. To use the "Interview" mode, follow the steps given below:

* Choose "Interview" and then click on the "Record" button.
* Click on "Stop" after you are done with the audio recording. After that, click on "Save" to save the final output.

### Step 4: Speech-to-Text Mode

"Speech to Text" is the last mode presented by the default voice recorder in Samsung S10/S9\. It converts your words into text efficiently. The user is only expected to choose the final output language that you want to transcribe into. Follow the step-by-step guide below to use this mode.

* Pick "Speed to Text" mode. Hit the "Record" button once you have gathered your thoughts.
