The pop-up screen moves the points near the Denoise label to eliminate the noise signal associated with the media file. You can also remove the noise associated with this video by selecting the Adjust Audio option by right-clicking the uploaded media file. You must save the changes by hitting the OK button before proceeding to the next step.

In the left pane, click the Sound Effects option, and in the right panel, select the desired audio file from the expanded list. Drag and drop the chosen audio file into the timeline. This action will automatically insert the audio effect into the imported media file.
