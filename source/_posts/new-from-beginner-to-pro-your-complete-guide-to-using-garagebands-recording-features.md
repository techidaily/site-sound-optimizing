Find the "Fade Out" option from the context menu. Double click on the target file and switch to the "Audio" column. Then drag the slider bar until the audio is faded to your liking. Then you can manually set the fade out the length by dragging the slider bar to the right or left. If you make a mistake or want to change the length, click the "Reset" button. Then click the "Play" button to play the newly faded audio track.

### 3\. Save the newly faded file

You can specify the output format, output name, and output folder. If you want to specify the detailed parameters, click the triangle beside the "Advanced settings" option and make changes by clicking the drop-down list. If you're satisfied with the result, click the "Export" button, and then an output window will pop up.

If you want to play the new file on mobile devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, Zune, go to the "Device" tab and choose a specific device from the list. You can also directly share the file to YouTube and Facebook in the "YouTube" tab or burn it to DVD in the "DVD" tab.
