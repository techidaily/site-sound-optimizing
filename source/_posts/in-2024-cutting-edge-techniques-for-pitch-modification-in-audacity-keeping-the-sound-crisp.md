## Cutting-Edge Techniques for Pitch Modification in Audacity: Keeping the Sound Crisp

You may raise or lower the pitch of a pre-recorded song. Likewise, you may apply the pitch-changing effect in real-time sound recording. Change in pitch affects your noise in certain ways. For instance, it can help you sound younger. Similarly, it can convert the male voice into a female voice. Another notable use of the pitch-changing technique is that you can produce sounds like cartoons. So, changing pitch can add a unique touch to your voice. You can also change pitch when recording in Audacity. The following article covers details about the **Audacity change pitch** feature. Let’s get started.

02 [How to Change Pitch in Audacity?](#part2)

## Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?

Not all sounds are the same. Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.

On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.

## Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?

Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries. Several applications offer sound editing tools to serve the needs of the people. Pitch-changing is one of the common tools that people look for in sound editors.

So, if you are editing sound in Audacity, changing the pitch is just a matter of a few clicks. Are you still wondering how you can apply the **Audacity change pitch** technique when editing? Here’s how you can do it in simple steps.

## "50 Best Film Scores: An Assortment for Every Video Format and Theme"

Montage is a film editing technique that combines a series of clips or shots into a single sequence. Background music is often applied to the final montage during compilation. We'll look at some of the best montage music for different video types and the benefits of adding them to your montage video.

## Why Music Is Important for Montage Video

Music plays an essential role in montage videos. Here are five reasons why you should add music to your montage video.

#### 1\. Music Captures Attention

One of the reasons people include music in montage videos is that it holds the audience's attention; it shapes emotion while motivating viewers. In addition to touching viewers, music makes the moving images in your montage video seem more beautiful and engaging. It also brings mood and dynamism to the video.

Musicologists have discovered that the choice of musical instruments, volume, harmony, and tempo play a vital role in montage video.

#### 2\. Music Takes Your Montage Video to the Next Level

By using music, you'll boost the cohesiveness and production value of your montage video. Your audience wants a professional montage video that is well-constructed and flows nicely. Music is the bridge that lets your montage video transition seamlessly between different scenes or ideas, particularly when you need to have a jump cut.

Additionally, montage music is a great way to fill in moments in your montage video that would have been silent. You can also use it to fill dead air in your video where there is a visual without sound.

#### 3\. Music Helps You to Communicate Your Message

Music is a vital component in conveying your message in your montage video. The music in your video should be in tune with the message you are trying to send.

#### 4\. Helps to Underscore the Unfolding Action

Montage music helps you to emphasize the action taking place in your video. As a result, this will make your audience focus on the action and get your message.

#### 5\. Helps You Create Rhythm for Your Montage Video

Music allows you to create a rhythm for scenes and clips in your montage video. A good rhythm can hold up your entire montage video.
