A team of scientists, musicians and engineers uses artificial intelligence to generate music designed to make your brain more productive and focused. They claim that the music created with their AI music composer achieve its effects in just ten to fifteen minutes. However, you can’t use Brain.fm to create your own music, as this platform is better suited for people who spend a lot of time at work and have a tough time maintaining their focus while performing important tasks.

**Conclusion**

The opportunities AI music composers offer are still not properly explored, because most of these technologies are still under development. The results AI music composers we included in this article have managed to achieve so far are impressive because each of them can produce high-quality audio files for all sorts of video content. Which AI music composer do you like to use the most? Leave a comment, and let us know.

Robots can’t be creative, right? A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You don’t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it. So, let’s take a look at what AI music composers have to offer in 2024.
