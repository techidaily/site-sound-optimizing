Users can narrow down their search to music that is just the perfect length for their content. That's a fantastic method to cut down on your editing efforts.

They include some intriguing subcategories for tracks, such as "hyena laugh sound effect," "canned laughter sound," "woman laughing sound effect," "which laugh sound effect," and so on, based on moods or feelings.

This is fantastic since you can quickly select music based on the content’s mood you want to convey.

## Part 2 Make Laughing Sound Effect by Yourself

Here is what you can do to create a sound effect by yourself. One way is to generate the sound effect by yourself.

For instance, if you want an evil laugh in mp3 format, you can ask your friends and relatives for a sample. It can even be a fun memory for both of you.

You can also record the laugh effect when you’re in a casual setting. Please note that the raw audio may not be usable without some significant editing to clean up ambient noise. This is where Wondershare’s Filmora comes into play.

Filmora is a tool for professional filmmaking or video editing that even beginners can use with ease. This video editing program has everything you'll want, including sophisticated capabilities and additions that you can download or supplement from Wondershare's database.
