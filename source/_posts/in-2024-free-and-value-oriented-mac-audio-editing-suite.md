You can remove the original audio in a pretty easy way if you want. To do this, just right click the video clip on Timeline, and select "Audio Detach". or "Mute" as per your needs.

#### 3\. Add audio to MP4 video

When all files come to place, you can begin to make the audio and video perfectly matched. In the Video Timeline, cut and paste any video clip to rearrange the order, and trim out unwanted portion while keeping the others. (Note: Don't overlap one into another, or you'll split the original file).

Now play your source MP4 video, and drag the audio track to the exact position that you want it to begin. If you just want a short part showing up, pause it when it comes to the right place. Then click the Scissors icon above the Timeline to split it into two parts. Keep what you want, and remove the others by hit "Delete" on the keyboard. Note that you can always click Undo/Redo to control your operation.
