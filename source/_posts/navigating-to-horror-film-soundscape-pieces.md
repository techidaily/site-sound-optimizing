## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)

**Step 3:** Afterward, click on your browser's search bar and type <www.y2mate.com>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-3.png)

**Step 4:** Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.

**Step 5:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![options showed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-2.png)

**Step 6:** Proceed to click on mp3 in the middle of the three options. There will be another list shown before you with only one choice this time.

**Step 7:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

### 2\. Make Scary Sound Effect by Yourself

02 [Use Filmora to Add Background Music to Your Video](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)

**Step 3:** Afterward, click on your browser's search bar and type <www.y2mate.com>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-3.png)

**Step 4:** Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.

**Step 5:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![options showed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-2.png)

**Step 6:** Proceed to click on mp3 in the middle of the three options. There will be another list shown before you with only one choice this time.

**Step 7:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-1.png)

That will download the entirety of the video in audio format only. All of this is free. Later in this article, we will show you how to cut and trim it.

### 2\. Make Scary Sound Effect by Yourself

If you are not satisfied with other scary sound effects or want something unique, you can make your sound effects. Initially, get a good-quality microphone with a pop filter for clear audio.

**Be Sure To Be In a Quiet Room with Padding:**

Connect the microphone to your computer make sure it is unmuted physically by pressing its button, as some microphones have a mute button on them.

**Make Sure the Microphone Is Unmuted In the Software:**

**Step 1:** Open a recording software, such as OBS Studio or audio recorder from Windows.

**Step 2:** Press record and make the sound effect you want.

**Step 3:** End the recording by pressing stop recording. You will now have recorded a scary music sound effect saved on your computer.

This method requires money for a good microphone, a pop filter, and padding.

### 3\. Getting Sound Effects from Free Websites

This option is attractive to many people, from beginners to people testing out the waters of audio editing. However, it should be noticed that the sound quality is not the best.

You can get free sound effects from websites such as Freesound.com or Soundeffectsplus.com.

**Step 1:** First of all, go to the website.

**Step 2:** Register an account

**Step 3:** Then search your desired sound effect

![search the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-7.png)

**Step 4:** Press download next to it.

Pretty straightforward, and as mentioned, these are free, but with limitations such as total download amount per month or licensing.

### 4\. Buying Sound Effects

If you have money but not time to make your audio effects, you can buy sound effects off the internet. Usually, these sellers have excellent quality audio; they can even make specific sound effects tailored to your needs.

* Many websites sell sound effects, including the likes of – <www.prosoundeffects.com> and <www.soundsnap.com>.
* Both websites are famous among the audio effects community; soundscape even provides audio for Nickelodeon, Disney, Pixar, HBO, and Netflix.
* As per usual, you first register an account.
* Once you are done with that, you buy the package you want, whether a one-time payment, bi-annual, or annual plan.
* These plans have different terms, such as 150 downloads per 6 months. Make sure of the times you will buy before you confirm the purchase.
* Then your search for the audio you want in the search bar
* Afterward, you click download. That’s it! You got it.

Now, let's talk about inserting them into your product; this requires an editor. And this is where Wondershare's editing software Filmora comes in.
