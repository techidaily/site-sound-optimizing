Unlike other MP3 mixers that are destructive when you are trying to edit the MP3 music file, this is not the case with Ocenaudio. With this software, you can tweak the parameters of the effect and hear the changes immediately.

Ocenaudio also supports VST; you can add your plugins when editing MP3 files. In addition, you can record audio straight in the software and use the spectrogram feature to visualize frequencies for advanced users. Professional music mixers would find this feature to be very welcoming.

 Pros

* It offers the spectrogram feature
* It is free to use
* Users can install their plugins
* Ocenaudio offers non-destructive music editing

 Cons

* It doesn’t support multi-track sessions
* Not ideal for professionals
