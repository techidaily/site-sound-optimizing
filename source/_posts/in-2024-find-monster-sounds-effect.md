#### Section 6: Apply unique Audio Effects

If you want to add specific effects to your audio files then use two simple methods on Vegas Pro with its Audio FX tool: One is to add effects on entire video file and second option is to make changes to specific layers of audio project. Use these steps to achieve great results:

**To entire audio layer**

![To entire audio layer ](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-9.jpg)

**To an individual portion of the audio layer**

![To portion](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-10.jpg)

![Audio track FX ](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-11.jpg)

For additional personalization you need to use plug-in chain button from right corner.

![Audio plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-12.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now select any desired effect from list that can make your audio track more impressive and press Add; once applied then hit OK.
