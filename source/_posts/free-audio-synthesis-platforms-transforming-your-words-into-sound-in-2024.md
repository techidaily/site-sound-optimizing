AMR is an abbreviation for Adaptive Multi-Rate Audio Codec. It is a technology that utilizes audio compression formats primarily for speech. A typical AMR speech codec will have a multi-rate of eight bitrate values that range from 4.75kb/s to 12.2 kb/s. The structure of AMR allows the creation of a group of 160 twenty millisecond long samples by the codec in one frame. The multi-rate codec available for normal AMR files include ACELP, DTX, CAD and CNG.

In addition to compressing speech, the AMR file format can also be used for the storage of spoken audio using the same codec. There are a number of modern telephones that has the capability to store short audio recordings using the AMR format. There are also other programs, both free and proprietary that can be used to convert files from this format to other various formats and vice versa. However, since AMR file format was initially designed for storing speech or audio recordings, quality is likely to be compromised if other media files are converted into AMR.

## How to Open AMR files on PC/Smartphone/Tablet

Though AMR file format was not designed for music and videos, there are certain instances when you might come across them and be confused on how to open them. The fact is that it is still possible to open AMR files with your personal computer, tablet, Smartphone or other devices.

In the case of a PC, the easiest way to open such a file is to simply double-click on it then allow the PC to decide which the most appropriate program to open it is.

If the already installed programs in your computer are unable to open the file, then the other alternative would be to search and download an appropriate AMR player. There are several sources from the internet that you can get such media player for absolutely free. If you prefer this route however, you need to be cautious and ensure that you don't download a program file that will hurt your computer. Ensure that you download the program from a trusted website. This is the only to avoid downloading viruses, spyware, malware and other malicious programs that might compromise the safety and security of your computer.

## Convert the AMR audio file to another Audio format

Some sites will require you to give your email address so that they send to you the converted file to your inbox. It is up to you to choose to whether or not to give your email address.

**Download AMR Converter software from** <http://www.mystikmedia.com/amr%5Fconverter.htm>
