## Ideas to Create a Funny Comedy Video or Vlog

Are you a funny person and want to create videos for your YouTube channel? If yes, then here are some ideas that you can try:

### 1\. Create a Comedy Skit

Many popular YouTube content creators create comedy skits to entertain their audience. These videos include humorous content and funny dialogues. To create a comedy skit you should have a center of the story, dialogues, characters, and comedy background music.

The major time that you will spend is gathering the ideas and creating a script. This requires brainstorming and at least one funny guy in your team. For inspiration, you can notice people around you and use them as inspiration.

### 2\. Things You Can Do with Everyday Household Items

Not specifically the eggs, but videos where people use regular items in unusual ways are sometimes funny. These videos will look funny when you include comedy background music. Some ideas of these types of videos are using eggs for various tasks other than cooking.

While creating these videos you can add funny elements like fixing a tile with the egg. These types of content are random, so it makes people laugh. And don’t forget comedy background music plays an essential role to make these videos funny.

### 3\. Visit a Park with Your Dog

Dogs are funny, especially when you take them to the place they like. When you will take your dog to the park and make vlogs about the journey, people will love it. While making vlogs you can record some exciting actions performed by your dog and upload them online. If you are thinking about how these clips will make your audience laugh, then the answer is simple, comedy background music.

### 4\. Make Reaction Videos

Reaction videos that you might have seen might not be funny. But, some content creators make funny reaction videos. They react to funny videos and use comedy background music to make the content engaging.

### 5\. Film a Prank

Prank videos are the most popular comedy videos on YouTube. In these videos, one or more people prank another person while the audience watching the video already knows. Many people who are fond of prank videos love the final reactions. If you want to create prank videos, you can add comedy background music for more fun.

### Closing Word

Comedy content creation is not as simple as it looks because you have to include humorous elements to make the videos funny. This includes a comedy script, funny act, and comedy background music. Background music is an important component to making engaging video content. On top of these components, you should download a video editor that helps you align your clips and comedy background music.

### 6. Round Audio Spectrum

Round audio spectrums are popular because they offer a simple way to visualize the music without taking away from it. Like many of the options on the Pond5 website, this one is built for modern versions of After Effects. It’s available in Full HD, and you don’t need anything else to add it to any project. It’s a clean, classy way to add some visuals to your next music project.

![Round Audio Spectrum](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/round-audio-spectrum.jpg)

### 7. Music Note for Music Party

Horizontal and Round options are pretty typical for audio visuals, but this music note takes it to a whole new level. While it still uses the technology you see in round options, it has two different ones connected by stems, which makes it look like a music note. The color is entirely uniform (other than the visualization areas on the circles), which gives it a clean, seamless look that you won’t find anywhere else. This is an excellent addition to any DJ’s repertoire or if you want to do something a little different with a music video for YouTube.

![Music Note for Music Party](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/music-note-for-music-party.jpg)

### 8. Free Audio Visualizer AE Templates

With multiple color options and an easy to customize the format, you’ll find it quite entrancing when you decide to use this for any of your projects. They even suggest you use it for podcasts and other speaking videos you may be uploading to YouTube because the colors help your audience to engage.

![Free Audio Visualizer AE Templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/free-audio-visualizer-ae-templates.jpg)

## 8 Best Audio Spectrum Templates

### 1. Audio Spectrum Music Visualizer

This audio-reactive visualizer is the ultimate option if you want to show off your music or share something that you enjoy. With a multiple number of customizable options, and various colors that you can use (6 dark and six bright), you will find that it’s straightforward to make it look exactly how you want it to look.

### 2. Free After Effects Audio Visualizer Velosofy

6Frame is a verified creator on Velosofy, and they have put together a unique visualize that is specially designed for hip-hop, jazz, and funk music styles. With an attractive background and multiple speeds available, this is a straightforward way for you to add some visualization to your next music upload. Everything is customizable, so you can really take it and make it your own, too.

### 3. Light Audio Spectrum

This visualizer is found over at VideoBlocks, which is an easy to use website that allows you to get your hands on all sorts of templates for After Effects and other video editing software options. This particular one uses the time-honored visualization that’s similar to what you’d see on a soundboard, with continually rising and falling bars that bring you into the music. It also has some light visuals on the upper half of the animation, which can make it feel like you’re DJing!

### 4. Animated Audio Spectrum

With 15 different options, this is a unique option that you can use to bring a little bit of visualization to your next YouTube video. It has ten radial spectrums, four horizontal spectrums, and the very unique animated avatar. The avatar is similar to the other audio spectrum visualizations, but it brings a more humanoid twist to it. This is available for use in After Effects and is at a standard 1920 x 1080 resolution and a visual speed of 60 Frames Per Second (FPS).

### 5. Ultimate Audio Spectrum

The Ultimate Audio Spectrum has a variety of visual appearances and audio visualizations, which makes it easy for you to find the one that you like and what you want to be able to use. It’s perfect for beginners because it has been coded in such a way that, if there’s an error, it automatically corrects without the user even seeing it. Flashes, pumps, bass effects, sliders, and even a space to put song information makes it simple for you to get things set up and then use it for any music video project.

### 6. Round Audio Spectrum

Round audio spectrums are popular because they offer a simple way to visualize the music without taking away from it. Like many of the options on the Pond5 website, this one is built for modern versions of After Effects. It’s available in Full HD, and you don’t need anything else to add it to any project. It’s a clean, classy way to add some visuals to your next music project.

![Round Audio Spectrum](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/round-audio-spectrum.jpg)

### 7. Music Note for Music Party

Horizontal and Round options are pretty typical for audio visuals, but this music note takes it to a whole new level. While it still uses the technology you see in round options, it has two different ones connected by stems, which makes it look like a music note. The color is entirely uniform (other than the visualization areas on the circles), which gives it a clean, seamless look that you won’t find anywhere else. This is an excellent addition to any DJ’s repertoire or if you want to do something a little different with a music video for YouTube.

# How to Add Audio to AVI

_With which tool can I add audio in an avi container? Because VDMod, Nandub and Avi-Mux is useless for this process..._

 Sometimes you may want to add audio to AVI but find many programs don't support this. So here I recommend a powerful video editing tool –[Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With it, you can easily add audio to AVI or other video formats such as MP3, WMA, OGG, or FLAC format and save it as a new file. Now download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and learn how to combine audio and video using the simple steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1 Add the files to the program

 Install and launch Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). Then import both the AVI file and audio track to this program. To do this, click the “Import” button or directly drag and drop them to the Media Item. Then select these added files and drop them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The video file should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the audio track.

![remove audio from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Adjust the audio file

 If the video and the soundtrack lengths do not match, you may need to edit the audio. For example, if the audio file is longer than your video, move the slider to the end of the audio, and drag it to fit the length of the video. If the video is longer than the music track, you can copy and paste the audio file and place the copied files side by side on the same track.

 If you want to further edit the original audio file, double click it and change the settings of speed, volume, pitch, fade in/out as you like.

 Note: if your AVI file already contains an audio track, you should remove it first. To do this, right click the AVI file and choose “Audio Detach” to separate the original audio from video. Then press “Delete” button on the keyboard to remove it.

![remove audio track from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/audio-detach.jpg)

#### 3 Save the new file

 After adding the audio and combining it with the video, you can export it as a new file. Click “Create ” and select “Format” tab. In the output window, select the required format. You can also go to the “Device” tab and export with the ready-made preset for your mobile device. Of course, you can also directly upload it to YouTube for sharing with the world or burn to DVD for playing on home TV.
