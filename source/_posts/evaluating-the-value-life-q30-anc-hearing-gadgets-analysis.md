## Evaluating the True Value of AppleCare+ Protection
[AppleCare+ is an extended warranty](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-warranty-plus-applecare-1999284) for Apple products, including iPads, iPhones, Macs, and Apple Watches. AppleCare+ gives you some extra time to get repairs at no extra cost and around-the-clock support by chat and phone, but is it worth the extra cost?

## How Does AppleCare+ Work?

 You can buy AppleCare+ when you first get your new device, or you have a window to decide. In most regions, you have 60 days to decide. You can also choose between one and two or three years of coverage, depending on the device. You may also be able to get an ongoing plan.

 The options per device are as follows:

* **Apple Display** : one or three years
* **Apple TV** : three years
* **Apple Watch** : monthly, two years, three years (Herm√®s only)
* **Headphones** : two years
* **HomePod** : two years
* **iPad** : monthly, two years
* **iPhone** : monthly, two years
* **Mac** : one or three years

 Along with this granularity, the iPhone also has two plans, one of which includes theft and loss for a few more dollars a month. If you decide not to get AppleCare+ and your item needs service, you may have another opportunity to buy a plan. The coverage won't apply to that repair or replacement, but you'll have it later if something else happens.

 The following table shows the general price of AppleCare for each kind of Apple product; coverage costs less for older models.

| |  Monthly    | 1 Year       | 2 Years        | 3 Years  |           |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Apple Display | \-           | $49.99-$179.99 | \-       | $149-$499 |
| Apple TV      | \-           | \-             | \-       | $29       |
| Apple Watch   | $2.49-$4.99  | \-             | $49-$99  | $149      |
| Headphones    | \-           | \-             | $29-$59  | \-        |
| HomePod       | \-           | \-             | $15-$39  | \-        |
| iPad          | $3.49-$7.99  | \-             | $69-$149 | \-        |
| iPhone        | $3.99-$13.49 | $79-$269       | \-       |           |
| Mac           | \-           | $64.99-$179.99 | \-       | $179-$499 |

## What Does AppleCare+ Cover?

 Apple products typically have a one-year warranty and 90 days of technical support. AppleCare+ extends this, covering up to four years from the date of purchase, and covers hardware and technical support.

 It also covers up to two incidents of accidental damage. Each claim is subject to a deductible. Still, this is less than the total price of a typical repair.

## The True Cost to You and Apple

 What are you buying with an extended warranty? The most significant benefit of AppleCare+ is coverage for accidental damage. It's unlikely you'll have a hardware failure that happens to occur in Year Two. Most hardware failures occur in the first year due to a defect or after several years of use.  

 However, you can drop your iPad and[crack the screen](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-do-cracked-ipad-screen-4056453) anytime. If you're particularly accident-prone or use your device in a challenging environment, the coverage can buy you peace of mind.

## Extended Warranty or Case

 An alternative to the extended warranty is a[good case for your iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/best-ipad-cases-4046942) . For example, the[Smart Case sold by Apple](https://www.apple.com/shop/ipad/accessories/cases-protection) is cheaper than the warranty and can protect an iPad if you drop it. It's also slim and form-fitting, and it wakes up the device when you open the cover. You won't notice any added bulk in size or inconvenience.

 Companies such as OtterBox and Trident also offer a variety of well-reviewed cases that are cheaper than the one-year warranty. These provide protection that ranges from the everyday, around-the-house type to rugged, waterproof options that can survive weather, mud, and larger drops.

 Good cases are available for iPads, iPhones, and Apple Watches. You may also find some for a MacBook, but they're less common, and you definitely won't see one for an Apple TV. These limitations may factor in to your decision to get coverage if other protection options exist.

## Extended Warranty or a Jar of Money

 One benefit of an extended warranty is the comfort of knowing you won't have a huge payout if you have a hardware failure or drop your iPad. That service charge and the AppleCare+ fee are less expensive than the cost to repair a cracked 9.7-inch iPad Pro screen.

 There's another way to get "insurance." Note the price of the warranty extension offered on any device you buy, and put half that money in a jar. After a few purchases, you should have enough to pay for a repair on any of your devices. After a few years, you'll have the same peace of mind at half the price.

 Another way to help decide on a warranty is to consider it as a percentage of the cost of the item. For example, an iPad 9 starts at $329, and the AppleCare+ costs $69 for three years (21%). A 12.9-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,099 with a two-year, $149 AppleCare+ plan (14%). Generally, the more expensive a device, the better value you're getting for the coverage.

## The Kid Factor

 The one situation in which extended warranties may be worth their cost is when kids are involved, primarily if, for example, your[iPad is intended for those kids](https://www.lifewire.com/should-your-toddler-or-preschooler-use-an-ipad-4069908) . Even a heavy-duty case won't protect a cracked screen if a kid slams the iPad against the corner of a table.  

 It is still an expensive warranty, but it might protect the device until the kids are old enough not to subject it to the kinds of abuse kids typically dish out.

## The AppleCare+ Verdict

 Skip it. Most of us have tablets, smartphones, and other electronic devices, such as gaming consoles and laptop computers.

 Instead of buying expensive extended warranties for each, set aside some money for the eventual repair that probability and statistics will bring your way and pocket the rest. You'll save money in the long run unless you have circumstances where accidental damage is likely.
