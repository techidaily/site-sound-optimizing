Solution to Fix Clownfish Voice Changer Not Working"></a>Part 4. Solution to Fix Clownfish Voice Changer Not Working</h2><p>While using Clownfish Voice Changer, you might also come across some troubles. They might be because either the voice changer is not updated, or maybe the apps you are using are not up to date. Let us share some fixes with you for smooth Clownfish functioning.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Update-Clownfish-Voice-Changer-3"><a href="#Fix-1-Update-Clownfish-Voice-Changer-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Update Clownfish Voice Changer"></a>Fix 1: Update Clownfish Voice Changer</h3><p>The most significant reason why you face trouble is that your Clownfish version is outdated. For this, you should update the voice changer to its latest version by following the steps given below:</p><p>Step 1: You have to start by opening the ‘Control Panel’ from the ‘Run’ window. For that, press ‘Windows and R’ together and then type ‘Control’ and press ‘Enter.’ Now, look for the ‘Programs’ section, and under that section, click on the ‘Uninstall a Program.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-12.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall a program"                ></p><p>Step 2: A list of all the installed programs will appear on the screen. From that list, look for ‘Clownfish Voice Changer’ and then left-click on it. Lastly, select the option of ‘Uninstall.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-13.jpg"                      alt="click on uninstall button"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once this is done successfully, head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://clownfish-translator.com/voicechanger/download.html" >official website of Clownfish Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install the latest version. Restart your computer and open the application to check if the problem has been resolved or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-14.jpg"                      alt="download clownfish latest version"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-the-Application’s-Version-3"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-the-Application’s-Version-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check the Application’s Version"></a>Fix 2: Check the Application’s Version</h3><p>Another reason that might be causing the problem is an incompatible version of the application with Clownfish. Both the voice changer and the application must have compatible versions. You can take assistance from the steps below to check the version of Skype.</p><p>Step 1: Start by opening Skype, and then from the left menu pane, click on your Skype profile. Then, from the quick access menu list, look for the ‘Settings’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-15.jpg"                      alt="open skype settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: After the ‘Settings’ window opens, click on the ‘Help &amp; Feedback’ option once located from the left pane. As the Help &amp; Feedback screen opens, you will see the Skype logo on the screen, and under the logo, you will see the version of Skype.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-16.jpg"                      alt="confirm skype version"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-3-Microphone-Installation-in-Clownfish-3"><a href="#Fix-3-Microphone-Installation-in-Clownfish-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Microphone Installation in Clownfish"></a>Fix 3: Microphone Installation in Clownfish</h3><p>The Voice changer is of no use if the microphone cannot be used as a microphone is an essential component for using a voice changer. An outdated microphone or wrongly installed microphone can cause an error in using Clownfish voice change.</p><p>Step 1: Run Clownfish on the computer and open it from the taskbar icon by right-clicking it. Keep your mouse over ‘Setup’ till the sub-menu opens.</p><p>Step 2: From the sub-menu, click on ‘System Integration.’ Then, select the microphone which is working fine, and click on ‘Install,’ which will install the microphone automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-17.jpg"                      alt="open system integration"                ></p><p>Step 3: After the installation of the microphone, reboot the computer.

In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.</p><p>Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.</p><p> While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased.

They help engage the audience, generate an emotional response, indicate mood, and much more. However, there’s one catch. As a video content creator, you must be already aware that not every sound effect or music you want to add to your video is available for free or available at all. This sometimes can be a real setback for a content creator. But what if I tell you there is a way around it? That you can get the music you want without paying extra bucks for it. Yes, a platform called YouTube Sound Library can resolve your issue. And help you find the music that you are longing for. Want to know how? Then read along.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Question 1: What is YouTube Sound library?](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Question 2: How to Find YouTube Sound Library?](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Question 3: Is YouTube Sound Library Free?](#Part 3)</p><p>04 [Question 4: How Can I Use YouTube Sound Library?](#Part 4)</p><p>05 [Question 5: How to Add Music from Sound Library to My Video?](#Part 5)</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-YouTube-Sound-library"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-YouTube-Sound-library" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is YouTube Sound library?"></a>Part 1 What is YouTube Sound library?</h2><p>Content creators are always treading the tightrope when it comes to budget. They are always watching out for a way to make their work cost-efficient by cutting costs wherever possible.</p><p>Sounds and music are some fields where you cannot afford to be cost-effective, as it is bound to hamper the quality of your final product. But buying the rights of music or sound can also have adverse effects on your purse. This is where YouTube Sound Library can save the day for you.</p><p>YouTube Sound Library is a segment of YouTube Studio dedicated to presenting content creators like you with royalty-free music from different genres, moods, and artists around the globe.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-YouTube-Sound-Library"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-YouTube-Sound-Library" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Find YouTube Sound Library?"></a>Part 2 How to Find YouTube Sound Library?</h2><p>It’s really easy to find YouTube sound effects library. It doesn’t matter if you are using a computer or a smartphone, it’s the same process that you need to follow.

The sound or the music you procure from this medium is royalty-free. And using it won’t incur the risk of a copyright strike against your content.</p><p>But just like every Google and YouTube tool available on the internet, YouTube Sound Library also comes with a bunch of terms and conditions. As a content creator and user of the audio from the library, you will be required to keep those terms and conditions in mind before using the music. If you somehow breach the guidelines mapped out by YouTube, you run the risk of a copyright strike against your content.</p><p>Therefore, before using the audio, thoroughly go through the content usage guidelines. Although they are not rocket science to start with, not honoring them can bite you later on.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-Can-I-Use-YouTube-Sound-Library"><a href="#Part-4-How-Can-I-Use-YouTube-Sound-Library" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How Can I Use YouTube Sound Library?"></a>Part 4 How Can I Use YouTube Sound Library?</h2><p>Downloading YouTube audio is very easy.

Right beneath it, you will be able to see a search and filter option. If you click on that, a drop-down menu with options such as: Title name, Genre, Mood, Artist name, etc., will appear in that order. You can select whatever choices suit your purpose and search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-audio-library-1.jpg"                      alt="search the library"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2-1"><a href="#Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>You can do the same if you want to search for music based on Genre or Mood.</p><p>All you need to do is select the option under Free Music and click on apply.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-audio-library-genre-alternative-and-punk.jpg"                      alt="select the option"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-1"><a href="#Step-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Once your searched options appear on the screen, you are provided with the option of listening to them before you proceed to download.</p><p>Click on the play option next to the name of the track&#x2F;music&#x2F;sound for a preview.

Instead of buying expensive music instruments, they can install dedicated plugins and get the same results without any hassle.</p><p>Of course, with so many available options, it can get a bit hectic to evaluate which VST plugins are worth installing. That’s why we’ve put together a list of 10 <strong>best free VST plugins</strong> so that you can pick the best ones to fulfill your requirements.</p><p>So, without any further ado, let’s start the list.</p><p>You might also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8 Best DAW for Chromebook to Make Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Free-VST-Plugins"><a href="#Best-Free-VST-Plugins" class="headerlink" title="Best Free VST Plugins"></a>Best Free VST Plugins</h2><h3 id="1-Native-Instruments"><a href="#1-Native-Instruments" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s a complete audio-mixing bundle that contains a variety of VST plugins, virtual instruments, thousands of audio effects, and several other free resources for music production.</p><p>Earlier all these elements were available individually. However, music producers can now access all these elements with a single product bundle, making the entire audio-mixing process more convenient and quick.</p><p>You can use the KOMPLETE START audio bundle with any VST, AU, and AAX plugin compatible DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Get Access to 2,000 sounds and more than 6 GB of content</li><li>Perfect for Beginners as KOMPLETE START has everything to step-up your music production game.</li><li>Compatible With Windows as well as Mac OS.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/native-instruments.JPG"                      alt="Native Instruments"                ></p><h3 id="2-Spitfire-LABS"><a href="#2-Spitfire-LABS" class="headerlink" title="2.

It would have been an injustice to exclude Spitfire Labs’ audio project from the list of <strong>best free VST plugins</strong> as it contains some of the unique audio effects one can integrate into their audio track.</p><p>What separates Spitfire Labs from other VST plugins is that every sound is composed of musicians and sampling experts in London, which means there’s no compromise on the quality whatsoever. And, since it features a wide variety of sounds, ranging from drums to actual natural sounds from the Northern Hemisphere, you’ll have no limitations on expressing your creativity.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Get a Variety of instrumental and natural sounds in one package.</li><li>Experts compose each audio effect&#x2F;sound.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/spitfireaudio.JPG"                      alt="Spitfire LABS"                ></p><h3 id="3-Sonatina-Orchestra"><a href="#3-Sonatina-Orchestra" class="headerlink" title="3.

It’s an orchestral sample library that contains pretty much all the elements you’ll need to create an orchestration virtually.</p><p>The library contains an array of audio samples, which have different amounts of stage ambiance, based on the placement of an instrument on the stage. It means you give your audio track a real orchestral vibe using different audio samples.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Different Types of audio samples including strings, brass, keys &amp; choir, etc.</li><li>Perfect for Beginners as well as slightly experienced music composers</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sonatina-symphonic-orchestra.JPG"                      alt="Sonatina Orchestra"                ></p><h3 id="4-Keyzone-Classic"><a href="#4-Keyzone-Classic" class="headerlink" title="4.

The plugin can be installed on any operating system, be it Mac or Windows, and works with the majority of DAWs.</p><p>If you want to add a piece of soft piano music in the background of your audio track, Keyzone Classic is the perfect option. Unlike the previous <strong>best free VST plugins</strong> in our list, Keyzone Classic isn’t a complete bundle, which makes it lightweight and easy-to-use.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Get a variety of presets including Yamaha Grand Piano, Steinway Grand Piano, Basic Electric Piano</li><li>Lightweight and easy-to-install.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/keyzoneclassic.JPG"                      alt="Keyzone Classic"                ></p><h3 id="5-Plogue-Sforzando"><a href="#5-Plogue-Sforzando" class="headerlink" title="5.

With Sforzando, you can create and share instruments for free, as well as commercial purposes.</p><p>Although it might not be a suitable option for beginners or even intermediate composers. <em>Why?</em> Because there is no fancy UI that’ll help you navigate through different elements. Everything needs to be done from scratch, that too, at the SFZ file level itself. In a nutshell, you must be a skilled and highly experienced composer to operate Plogue Sforzando.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Uses SFZ file format, which is royalty-free, which means you can create and distribute instruments without any restrictions.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sforzando.JPG"                      alt="Plogue Sforzando"                ></p><h3 id="6-Simple-Sound-Delay-Plugin"><a href="#6-Simple-Sound-Delay-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="6.

It can be used in any DAW to delay audio signals with extremely accurate precision. The plugin allows you to postpone time by setting a time-frame in milliseconds or using the samples.</p><p>However, being one of the standalone and <strong>free VST plugins</strong>, Sound Delay can only be used to delay audio signals. Apart from this, it doesn’t provide any functionality whatsoever. Sound Delay is an appropriate option for music composers who have already installed dozens of individual VST plugins and want a new one that’ll help them delay audio signals as well.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Delay Audio Signals in milliseconds or using samples</li><li>Delay mid &amp; side-channels separately</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sounddelay.JPG"                      alt="Simple Sound Delay Plugin"                ></p><h3 id="7-Tube-Amplifier-Plugin"><a href="#7-Tube-Amplifier-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="7.

By no means, TubeAmp is the right choice for a beginner as one must be familiar with tube-triode.</p><p>However, if you’re an experienced music composer, Tube Amplifier will fit your studio perfectly. As we mentioned earlier, it can be used to apply asymmetric tube triode overdrive, which is usually found in single-tube microphone preamp boxes. It also contains a low-pass filter that’ll help you imitate a low-quality tube-triode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Asymmetric tube triode overdrive</li><li>Two processing modes</li><li>Additional output saturation stage</li><li>Stereo and multi-channel processing</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/tubeamp.JPG"                      alt="Tube Amplifier Plugin"                ></p><h3 id="8-Ozone-Imager-V2"><a href="#8-Ozone-Imager-V2" class="headerlink" title="8.

The tool has three different vectorscope meters that instantly show the stereo width and help you widen or narrow the sounds precisely as per the project requirements.</p><p>Ozone Imager also has a dedicated “Stereoize” feature that’ll help you turn mono sounds into stereo without any reverb. This will make it easier to enhance the overall audio effects and give a professional touch to your tracks.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Stereoize the sounds with no need for doubling</li><li>Visualize the sounds using vectorscope meters to precisely adjust their width</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/ozone-imager.JPG"                      alt="Ozone Imager V2"                ></p><h3 id="9-RS-W2395c-by-Fuse-Audio-Labs"><a href="#9-RS-W2395c-by-Fuse-Audio-Labs" class="headerlink" title="9.

It offers an extremely straightforward UI, which will make it easier for all the hobbyist music composers to switch low and mid-bands without having to dive deeper into the “Settings” menu.</p><p>The dedicated high-shelf will give you the liberty to carve darkening instruments and voices. This will help you compose audio tracks that stand out in the crowd.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Extremely Flexible UI</li><li>Easily Control Mid &amp; Low Bands for your track</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fuseaudiolabs.JPG"                      alt="RS-W2395c by Fuse Audio Labs"                ></p><h3 id="10-Sound-Recovery"><a href="#10-Sound-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="10.

The plugin will help you adjust mid &amp; high frequencies to an optimal level or add them if they’re missing in a soundtrack. So, if you have any tracks that require a slight polishing, Sound Recovery will help.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Erase Unwanted Noises from an Audio Track</li><li>After repairing a track, save the preset for future use</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/soundrecovery.JPG"                      alt="Sound Recovery"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><h5 id="Benjamin-Arango-1"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango-1" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>With the release of different VST plugins, it has become more convenient and inexpensive for a music producer to mix a track.

You can keep changing until you are satisfied.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-11.jpg"                      alt="increase the pitch"                ></p><p>Step 5: Lastly, don’t forget to save the changes by hitting the ‘OK’ button at the button and saving the file to your respective device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-12.jpg"                      alt="confirm the pitch settings"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Create-Robot-Voice-in-Audacity-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Create-Robot-Voice-in-Audacity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How to Create Robot Voice in Audacity?"></a>Part 4. How to Create Robot Voice in Audacity?</h2><p>As we have mentioned, Audacity is an audio voice changer, so you must know that Audacity also can change your voice into a robotic voice. Among the different voices, the robot voice sounds interesting, and it’s fun to create. If you are excited to learn to create robot voice in Audacity, follow the guiding steps shared below:</p><p>Step 1: For creating an extraordinary robotic voice, start by launching Audacity on your device. After it opens, it’s time to record your voice to create a robot voice. Or else, head to the ‘File’ tab and import your audio file from your device to Audacity from the ‘Open’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-13.jpg"                      alt="open your audio track"                ></p><p>Step 2: After this, to start the editing, you need a stereo track on the timeline. For doing this, navigate ‘Tracks’ from the top menu and click on it. Next, hover on the ‘Add New’ option to open its sub-menu. You will see the ‘Stereo Track’ option, select it, and copy-paste the audio file in the new section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-14.jpg"                      alt="select stereo track option"                ></p><p>Step 3: Let’s start with the fun part, the editing and adjusting different features. Start by opening the ‘Effects’ tab, and from the long list of options, select ‘Echo.’ There, you can enter the ‘Delay Time’ and change other fields as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-15.jpg"                      alt="adjust echo settings"                ></p><p>Step 4: Preview the audio and move on to the next setting. Open the ‘Effects’ section and look for the ‘Change Pitch’ option. You can change and adjust the pitch according to your desire and preview the file again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-16.jpg"                      alt="customize change pitch effect"                ></p><p>Step 5: For creating a robot voice, you can also set the tempo. For that, head to the ‘Change Tempo’ option under the ‘Effects’ section and set the value to minus. Keep adjusting the different effects until you get your perfect robot voice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-17.jpg"                      alt="edit temp settings"                ></p><h3 id="Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>Audacity is not only a great audio editor; it is also a stunning audio voice changer.
