    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unlocking-Clearer-Listening-The-Complete-Process-of-Audio-Level-Standardization-in-VLC"><a href="#Unlocking-Clearer-Listening-The-Complete-Process-of-Audio-Level-Standardization-in-VLC" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking Clearer Listening: The Complete Process of Audio Level Standardization in VLC"></a>Unlocking Clearer Listening: The Complete Process of Audio Level Standardization in VLC</h2><h2 id="How-To-Normalize-Volume-in-VLC"><a href="#How-To-Normalize-Volume-in-VLC" class="headerlink" title="How To Normalize Volume in VLC"></a>How To Normalize Volume in VLC</h2><p>How to normalize volume, why should we do it, and what is it after all? – these are the questions when it comes to editing our audio files, as well as the video clips we tend to change the sound of. So, first of all, the volume normalization is pretty much explained as follows: The process when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, which is “the norm” for the project. If it is a little bit difficult to understand, we have to highlight that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.</p><p>But, why bother at all and why not leave it the way it is? Well, the answer to this is almost the same as on why editing exists in general, right? Things are not perfect! This is the fact that prompts us to make our video clips and audio better, improve it at least on the level which can get us the right amount of viewers and listeners. Everyone have had some pain listening to several podcasts, when the volume was too high or too low, or there were so much background noise that the whole recording was hurting the ears of a person! People will not convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners if their user experience is not favored. So, it is in our best interest to serve their best interest, with a little bit of editing.</p><p>When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.</p><p>In the first case, you might have somewhat quite voice recording, and would like to make it better without changing its dynamic range, while making it as loud as possible. And when it comes to matching volumes, it is logical that you need to manipulate your editing this way in case you have a group of audio files, each or some of them are at different volumes, so, understandably, if not necessarily, you would like to make them come closer to the same volume.</p><p>So, until we give you the step-by step guide on how to normalize your volume in VLC player, we also need to inform you about audio normalization types. Here, generally, we come across three of them: a so-called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; another is called loudness normalization and it adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness. Last but not least, RMS (Root-Mean-Square), changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p><p>Using any of this, making it better to listen to your voice, without people being annoyed and their ears becoming exhausting with what you have to offer, you will be making it enjoyable for them and easy to come back to your content, as they will not be obliged to change the volume on their own audio players. Instead, their experience with you will be calm and effortless, which you are aiming to achieve.</p><p>So, not, what about VLC? – this is a very popular media player, favorite for a lot of people all around the world, so you should already be quite familiar with what it is, at least by having streamed videos and movies there. Speaking more of what it represents, it is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It is worth noting that it can also play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC and additionally, the program can stream from popular websites such as Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and so on.</p><p>As if it was not enough, you can do simple video and audio editing in VLC Media Player, which a lot of people are unaware of! For example, you can easily trim and cut videos. So, as it happens, we can also normalize volume in VLC Media Player. It is a very handy feature and it works on Windows as well as on Mac. Sooo… How to do that? Because, actually, it is so simple that you might be surprised you didn’t know about this earlier. To learn how to normalize volume in VLC, follow this simple guideline:</p><p>First, of course, as every time working with any software, you need to have VLC Media Player installed on your device. Once you have it installed, open VLC. Go to the Tools and Preferences and there, you will need to check the single box which is next to Normalize volume in Effects. Now, set the level to the one that works best for you. Then, when you are happy with the result, you can Save.</p><p>This is not something perfect, because it’s so simple to do and actually what it does is just help adjust the general volume, so it leaves the specifics alone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-1.jpg"                      alt="help adjust general volume"                ></p><p>But, it might be the case that you are not so satisfied with the simple editing and want a little more to get from the editing process on VLC. So, you can do more with the Audio Effects menu there. And the steps are as follows:</p><p>First, on your VLC player, find Tools and then, in the menu, go to Preferences. The window will open, and there you need to select All in Show settings – actually it is a little bit hard to find because this is in the bottom left corner of the window. From there, you will need to navigate to Audio, and then, a little below, click on Filters and highlight it. The checkbox next to the Dynamic range compressor will probably be unchecked – so, check in it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-2.jpg"                      alt="find tools and go to preferences"                ></p><p>Next, see where Compressor is in the left panel? Select it. And now, you are free to make the changes to the levels as you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-3.jpg"                      alt="see compressor"                ></p><p>Here, if you are a little bit overwhelmed with the wide range of options to work on, you can just concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.</p><p>Don’t underestimate Attack time and release time, either. They graduate the changes to ramp them up at first, then down again, rather than initiating them immediately. So, if you set them to your liking as well, this will ensure that you have a more fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, sometimes scary volume changes.</p><p>Therefore, you are now equipped with the most information you will need to normalize volume in VLC Player – so free to give it a go, play around with the different settings and carry out the best result imaginable for you!</p><h2 id="How-to-normalize-audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-normalize-audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to normalize audio in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>How to normalize audio in Wondershare Filmora?</h2><p>Now, even though we already know how to normalize audio in VLC in the simplest, as well as in the more advanced way, it might be even better if we know some more about normalizing audios in different programs.

Adding non-copyrighted music to your montages can help you capture the viewer’s attention and communicate your message. We’ll give you the definition of copyright and why it is crucial to use royalty-free music in your montage videos. We have given an overview of some of the most popular royalty-free montage music tracks and where you can download them.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Copyright"><a href="#What-Is-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="What Is Copyright?"></a>What Is Copyright?</h2><p>If you are wondering: What is copyright? It’s a sort of intellectual property designed to give its owner the entire right of copying and distributing creative work, often for a limited time. Essentially, the creative work could be in a musical, educational, artistic, or literary form.</p><p>Copyright protects the creator of the work from unauthorized use or duplication. The original work must be tangible for copyright laws to protect it.</p><p>If you’re caught using copyrighted material that a legal copyright owner owns, you’ll have to pay them civil damages. Infringing upon anyone’s intellectual property rights by using their copyright without their permission means you are guilty of copyright infringement.</p><p>Claiming you didn’t know about the artist’s copyrighted material doesn’t excuse you from using it in your montage video without their consent.</p><p>If you use copyrighted music in your montage video without the artist’s consent and profit from it commercially, you may have to pay the owner of the song monetary damages. The court may also ask you to give the artist your profits as restitution.</p><p>The maximum statutory damage for the act of copyright piracy can go as high as 150,000 dollars along with court costs and attorney fees. What’s the worst part? You could lose your freedom, as copyright infringement can land you in jail in extreme cases.</p><p>For these reasons, you might want to pay attention to copyright issues when creating a montage video. Make sure you use non-copyright music when making your video montage.</p><h2 id="Top-15-Non-Copyrighted-Music-for-montages"><a href="#Top-15-Non-Copyrighted-Music-for-montages" class="headerlink" title="Top 15 Non-Copyrighted Music for montages"></a>Top 15 Non-Copyrighted Music for montages</h2><p>If you are looking for free montage music to keep your audience engaged with your content when viewing it, we have highlighted some great options.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="“Most-Popular-Websites-Offering-Montage-Audio-Archives”"><a href="#“Most-Popular-Websites-Offering-Montage-Audio-Archives”" class="headerlink" title="“Most Popular Websites Offering Montage Audio Archives”"></a>“Most Popular Websites Offering Montage Audio Archives”</h2><p>In music, montage is a technique whereby newly branded compositions or sound objects, such as songs, are created from montage or collage. We will give you all the information you need to know before going for a montage music download. We will also highlight where you can get music tracks to add to your montage video.</p><h2 id="Things-to-Be-Aware-of-Before-Downloading-Montage-Music"><a href="#Things-to-Be-Aware-of-Before-Downloading-Montage-Music" class="headerlink" title="Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music"></a>Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music</h2><p>Before you download montage music, you must factor in the following crucial things:</p><h4 id="1-The-Storage-Space-Available-on-Your-Target-Device"><a href="#1-The-Storage-Space-Available-on-Your-Target-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device"></a>1. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device</h4><p>Unlike documents, montage music takes loads of space. If you plan to download many tracks, you might run out of disk space if your device has limited storage space. For this reason, before you start looking for downloadable montage music, check if you have ample space on your target drive.</p><p>If your disk space is almost depleted, you can delete some files that you rarely use or back them up in another drive. You can also uninstall apps or programs that you rarely use but are readily available online. If you are using your mobile device to download montage music, you can expand the memory.</p><h4 id="2-The-Safety-of-Your-Device"><a href="#2-The-Safety-of-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="2. The Safety of Your Device"></a>2. The Safety of Your Device</h4><p>When looking for free downloadable montage music, you have to factor in the safety of your device. Attacks by cybercriminals are now targeting individuals. Be extra vigilant with the platforms you choose. The site you pick should have a good reputation in dealing with threats.</p><p>Before you download montage music, you need to consider the site you are getting them from: Not all sites are equal in quality and legality; some may be more reliable.</p><p>Do your research before downloading montage music from any site. Ensure the website is legit to avoid downloading files with malware or viruses.</p><h4 id="3-Internet-Connectivity"><a href="#3-Internet-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Internet Connectivity"></a>3. Internet Connectivity</h4><p>You’ll need a strong internet connection to montage music download. Most people use mobile phone contracts with specific data caps that do not allow venturing outside email or the usual social media connection.</p><p>If you download montage music using a phone contract, there’s a risk that you might exhaust the allocated data and incur additional charges. You should, therefore, understand when and where to download montage music.</p><p>If you’ve got free Wi-Fi at work, you might want to schedule all the montage music downloads and run them while doing your job. You can also download montage music using free Wi-Fi hubs around establishments like government facilities and hospitals. But, be extra careful with open Wi-Fi, as cybercriminals use this channel to hit targets.</p><h4 id="4-The-Copyright-Status-Of-The-Montage-Music"><a href="#4-The-Copyright-Status-Of-The-Montage-Music" class="headerlink" title="4. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music"></a>4. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music</h4><p>When downloading montage music, it’s crucial to be aware of its copyright status. Some montage music tracks have copyright law protection, meaning downloading them will be violating the law.</p><p>Before you download any montage music online, read the download site’s terms and conditions. In turn, this will help you to understand what is allowed and what is not.</p><h4 id="5-The-Quality-of-the-Montage-Music-File"><a href="#5-The-Quality-of-the-Montage-Music-File" class="headerlink" title="5. The Quality of the Montage Music File"></a>5. The Quality of the Montage Music File</h4><p>Some montage music files you’ll find online are of low quality. And this can affect your audience’s listening experience. Before you get any downloadable montage music, check its quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118320/7443" target="_top" id="2118320">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118320" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118320/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-Websites-to-Download-Montage-Music"><a href="#Top-10-Websites-to-Download-Montage-Music" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Websites to Download Montage Music"></a>Top 10 Websites to Download Montage Music</h2><p>There are lots of sites where you can download montage music tracks.

That’s when we follow the process of audio ducking in <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> that would automatically lower the volume of the background music whenever there is a dialogue.</p><p>The best thing about Premiere Pro audio ducking is that it is an automatic process and we don’t need to put a lot of effort. To make your job easier, I’m going to let you know how to use the Adobe Premiere Pro audio ducking feature in a step by step manner in this guide.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Audio-Ducking-to-Balance-Music-and-Voiceover-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Audio-Ducking-to-Balance-Music-and-Voiceover-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Audio Ducking to Balance Music and Voiceover in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?"></a>Part 1: How to Use Audio Ducking to Balance Music and Voiceover in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?</h2><p>If you have been using Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac, then you would already be familiar with the wide range of editing features that it has. One of them is the Premiere Pro audio ducking option that comes inbuilt in the application. Using it, you can automatically lower the volume of the background music and amplify your dialogues.</p><p>To perform auto-ducking in Premiere Pro, we first need to define each audio track and then use the ducking feature. Here’s how you can also perform audio ducking in Premiere Pro like a pro.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Define-the-Audio-Types"><a href="#Step-1-Define-the-Audio-Types" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Define the Audio Types"></a>Step 1: Define the Audio Types</h4><p>Since Adobe Premiere Pro can’t automatically detect the type of sounds, you need to do it manually. To do audio ducking in Premiere Pro, you can first import your video clip and the voiceover to the application, and drag them to the working timeline.</p><p>Now, you can first select the voiceover file that you want to amplify, and from the sidebar on the right, click on “Dialogue” as the type of the audio file.</p><p>Once you mark the audio type, you will get different options. Here, go to the “Loudness” option and click on the “Auto Match” button.</p><p>Afterward, you can do the same for your background audio file. Select the file and choose its audio type as “Music”. You can also set its loudness to “Auto Match” if you want to.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Perform-Auto-Ducking-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Perform-Auto-Ducking-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Perform Auto Ducking in Premiere Pro"></a>Step 2: Perform Auto Ducking in Premiere Pro</h4><p>Now when you have set the audio types, you can just find the Ducking option on the sidebar and turn it on. Here, you can first click on the dialogue icon from the top and get the needed options. You can adjust its sensitivity and set a level or improve or reduce its quality.</p><p>Apart from the dialogue icon, you can also click on the Music icon and do the same. For instance, you can reduce the quality of the background music and increase the level of the dialogue track.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Make-the-Final-Changes"><a href="#Step-3-Make-the-Final-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Make the Final Changes"></a>Step 3: Make the Final Changes</h4><p>Great! You can now preview the changes you have made and check the audio ducking results in Premiere Pro. If you want to finalize things, then you can perform keyframing and manually adjust the volume.</p><p>Furthermore, you can also perform an instant hard ducking in Premiere Pro. For this, just choose the track, go to the side panel, and select <strong>Preset</strong> &gt; <strong>Music</strong> &gt; <strong>Hard Vocal Ducking</strong>. While it would get instant results in Adobe Premiere audio ducking, the results might not be so effective.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 2: Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>As you can see, the Premiere Pro audio ducking feature can get a bit complicated if you are a beginner.

This will let you save the project in the desired format and resolution on your computer.</p><p>Who knew it would be so easy to do auto-ducking in Premiere Pro, right? Though, if you are looking for even a simpler alternative to Adobe Premiere audio ducking, then consider using Wondershare Filmora. A user-friendly and resourceful video editor, it offers a wide range of features and other inbuilt tools that would meet every post-production requirement of yours in one place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-explore-the-world-of-fb-live-broadcasting/"><u>[New] Explore the World of FB Live Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discovering-10-ultimate-pic-finder-portals/"><u>2024 Approved Discovering 10 Ultimate Pic Finder Portals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-with-imei-code-from-your-iphone-6-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code From your iPhone 6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/charting-new-territory-after-magixs-acid-pro-for-2024/"><u>Charting New Territory After Magix's ACID Pro for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/demystifying-smooth-audio-conversions-crossfade/"><u>Demystifying Smooth Audio Conversions (Crossfade)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-comprehensive-guide-to-previewing-facebooks-hidden-activities/"><u>In 2024, A Comprehensive Guide to Previewing Facebook's Hidden Activities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-iphone-se-activation-lock-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Remove iPhone SE Activation Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-through-music-production-software-landscape-can-magix-samplitude-be-considered-supreme/"><u>In 2024, Navigating Through Music Production Software Landscape Can MAGIX Samplitude Be Considered Supreme?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/mastering-virtual-realities-unleash-power-in-kinemaster-and-its-leading-rivals/"><u>Mastering Virtual Realities Unleash Power in KineMaster & Its Leading Rivals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhancing-film-production-adding-audio-elements-in-magix-pro-2023-edition/"><u>New 2024 Approved Enhancing Film Production Adding Audio Elements in Magix Pro 2023 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-choreographed-audio-selecting-superior-soundtracks-for-montage-masterpieces/"><u>New Choreographed Audio Selecting Superior Soundtracks for Montage Masterpieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ideal-eq-settings-to-maximize-your-devices-hearing-capabilities/"><u>New In 2024, Ideal EQ Settings to Maximize Your Devices Hearing Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfect-harmony-unveiling-the-best-5-mixers-for-mac-enthusiasts/"><u>New In 2024, Perfect Harmony Unveiling the Best 5 Mixers for Mac Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-compendium-of-chromes-best-audio-recording-software/"><u>New The Ultimate Compendium of Chromes Best Audio Recording Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/remove-rog-phone-8-pro-unlock-screen-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Remove ROG Phone 8 Pro unlock screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-experts-choice-the-top-10-digital-stores-specializing-in-montage-music-downloads/"><u>Updated In 2024, Experts Choice The Top 10 Digital Stores Specializing in Montage Music Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mp4-file-optimization-removing-unwanted-audio-tracks/"><u>Updated In 2024, MP4 File Optimization Removing Unwanted Audio Tracks</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Finding specific edit locations when editing footage or keyframing effects is made simpler by these characteristics. Audio waveforms in Final Cut Pro alter based on the volume of a clip or any applied effects. When the volume is high, the waveform is larger; when the volume is low, it is smaller. But when using FCP to edit video, people frequently experience issues with <strong>audio waveform disappearing</strong>. Or you do want to <strong>add some dynamic effects for audio waves</strong>?

This is a great approach for beginners or people who do not have production experience. Probably you do not want to waste time finding the audio files, converting them from iTunes, and bringing them into a DAW. A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic system that is designed for recording, editing, and playing back digital audio files.

Now download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and learn how to combine audio and video using the simple steps below.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="1-Add-the-files-to-the-program-3"><a href="#1-Add-the-files-to-the-program-3" class="headerlink" title="1 Add the files to the program"></a>1 Add the files to the program</h4><p> Install and launch Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). Then import both the AVI file and audio track to this program. To do this, click the “Import” button or directly drag and drop them to the Media Item. Then select these added files and drop them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The video file should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the audio track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg"                      alt="remove audio from avi"                ></p><h4 id="2-Adjust-the-audio-file-3"><a href="#2-Adjust-the-audio-file-3" class="headerlink" title="2 Adjust the audio file"></a>2 Adjust the audio file</h4><p> If the video and the soundtrack lengths do not match, you may need to edit the audio. For example, if the audio file is longer than your video, move the slider to the end of the audio, and drag it to fit the length of the video. If the video is longer than the music track, you can copy and paste the audio file and place the copied files side by side on the same track.</p><p> If you want to further edit the original audio file, double click it and change the settings of speed, volume, pitch, fade in&#x2F;out as you like.</p><p> Note: if your AVI file already contains an audio track, you should remove it first. To do this, right click the AVI file and choose “Audio Detach” to separate the original audio from video. Then press “Delete” button on the keyboard to remove it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/audio-detach.jpg"                      alt="remove audio track from avi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094418/7443" target="_top" id="2094418">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094418" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094418/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Save-the-new-file-3"><a href="#3-Save-the-new-file-3" class="headerlink" title="3 Save the new file"></a>3 Save the new file</h4><p> After adding the audio and combining it with the video, you can export it as a new file.

So, first of all, the volume normalization is pretty much explained as follows: The process when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, which is “the norm” for the project. If it is a little bit difficult to understand, we have to highlight that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.</p><p>But, why bother at all and why not leave it the way it is? Well, the answer to this is almost the same as on why editing exists in general, right? Things are not perfect! This is the fact that prompts us to make our video clips and audio better, improve it at least on the level which can get us the right amount of viewers and listeners. Everyone have had some pain listening to several podcasts, when the volume was too high or too low, or there were so much background noise that the whole recording was hurting the ears of a person! People will not convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners if their user experience is not favored. So, it is in our best interest to serve their best interest, with a little bit of editing.</p><p>When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.</p><p>In the first case, you might have somewhat quite voice recording, and would like to make it better without changing its dynamic range, while making it as loud as possible. And when it comes to matching volumes, it is logical that you need to manipulate your editing this way in case you have a group of audio files, each or some of them are at different volumes, so, understandably, if not necessarily, you would like to make them come closer to the same volume.</p><p>So, until we give you the step-by step guide on how to normalize your volume in VLC player, we also need to inform you about audio normalization types. Here, generally, we come across three of them: a so-called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; another is called loudness normalization and it adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness. Last but not least, RMS (Root-Mean-Square), changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p><p>Using any of this, making it better to listen to your voice, without people being annoyed and their ears becoming exhausting with what you have to offer, you will be making it enjoyable for them and easy to come back to your content, as they will not be obliged to change the volume on their own audio players. Instead, their experience with you will be calm and effortless, which you are aiming to achieve.</p><p>So, not, what about VLC? – this is a very popular media player, favorite for a lot of people all around the world, so you should already be quite familiar with what it is, at least by having streamed videos and movies there. Speaking more of what it represents, it is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It is worth noting that it can also play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC and additionally, the program can stream from popular websites such as Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and so on.</p><p>As if it was not enough, you can do simple video and audio editing in VLC Media Player, which a lot of people are unaware of! For example, you can easily trim and cut videos. So, as it happens, we can also normalize volume in VLC Media Player. It is a very handy feature and it works on Windows as well as on Mac. Sooo… How to do that? Because, actually, it is so simple that you might be surprised you didn’t know about this earlier. To learn how to normalize volume in VLC, follow this simple guideline:</p><p>First, of course, as every time working with any software, you need to have VLC Media Player installed on your device. Once you have it installed, open VLC. Go to the Tools and Preferences and there, you will need to check the single box which is next to Normalize volume in Effects. Now, set the level to the one that works best for you. Then, when you are happy with the result, you can Save.</p><p>This is not something perfect, because it’s so simple to do and actually what it does is just help adjust the general volume, so it leaves the specifics alone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-1.jpg"                      alt="help adjust general volume"                ></p><p>But, it might be the case that you are not so satisfied with the simple editing and want a little more to get from the editing process on VLC. So, you can do more with the Audio Effects menu there. And the steps are as follows:</p><p>First, on your VLC player, find Tools and then, in the menu, go to Preferences. The window will open, and there you need to select All in Show settings – actually it is a little bit hard to find because this is in the bottom left corner of the window. From there, you will need to navigate to Audio, and then, a little below, click on Filters and highlight it. The checkbox next to the Dynamic range compressor will probably be unchecked – so, check in it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-2.jpg"                      alt="find tools and go to preferences"                ></p><p>Next, see where Compressor is in the left panel? Select it. And now, you are free to make the changes to the levels as you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-3.jpg"                      alt="see compressor"                ></p><p>Here, if you are a little bit overwhelmed with the wide range of options to work on, you can just concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.</p><p>Don’t underestimate Attack time and release time, either. They graduate the changes to ramp them up at first, then down again, rather than initiating them immediately. So, if you set them to your liking as well, this will ensure that you have a more fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, sometimes scary volume changes.</p><p>Therefore, you are now equipped with the most information you will need to normalize volume in VLC Player – so free to give it a go, play around with the different settings and carry out the best result imaginable for you!</p><h2 id="How-to-normalize-audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-normalize-audio-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to normalize audio in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>How to normalize audio in Wondershare Filmora?</h2><p>Now, even though we already know how to normalize audio in VLC in the simplest, as well as in the more advanced way, it might be even better if we know some more about normalizing audios in different programs. Something worth discussing is a software called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which carries out the same task wonderfully.

And, actually, it is a qhile that Wondershare Filmora X introduced the feature to normalize the audio for the first time. What to say more - you might want to stop now and download the latest version of Filmora because now we are about to learn how to normalize audio from the video there – so, tune in <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Free Download"                > For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151892/7443" target="_top" id="2151892">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151892" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151892/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>When it is done installing, open the software.

On top of this, OLED frames are thinner and lighter than their LED predecessors. It’s a powerful combination that makes for a startlingly realistic picture alongside an expanded range of placement options. In the case of the LG C9, it’s a design that’s as smart as it is sleek thanks to the inclusion of Google Assistant and Alexa.</p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED 65-inch C9 (OLED65C9PUA).</p><p> The LG C9 itself is comprised of a pane of glass that covers the OLED panel. This pane stretches across the front of the TV, leaving a remarkable 0.3 inches between the end of the OLED panel and the metal edge. When it is mounted on a wall, the C9 looks fantastic thanks to this slim, bezel-less design, and while it boasts an impressive 65-inch screen, at no point does this top-of-the-line model exceed a width of 1.8 inches.</p><p> For customers with multiple external devices, such as Blu-ray players or gaming consoles, ports are located along the TV’s left-hand side and directly on its backside. These connection options include 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.1 ports, 3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one cable&#x2F;antenna input, one LAN port, and audio connections. The HDMI 2.1 ports are especially important since consoles began emerging in 2020 that rely on HDMI 2.1 such as the Playstation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mxKfDJGuIKYcsSIQoKfzwDbYYmg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_02-3da87ff8439343f691cf02e9234d1f04.jpg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884002/19272" target="_top" id="1884002">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884002" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884002/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand"><a href="#Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand"></a><strong>Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand</strong></h2><p> Due to its large size and fragile nature, consider where the LG C9 will be most secure before moving ahead with setup. It shouldn’t be placed anywhere where there’s a risk it could be knocked down or climbed on, for instance, so choose a location safely tucked away from pets and children.</p><p> Setup options include securing the TV to the wall or using the provided stand as a table mount. Be careful, however, as the slim frame means that it needs to be handled with care regardless of where it’s placed, otherwise the TV is at risk of bending which could damage the OLED panel. You’ll want to make sure you’ve got an extra pair of hands for any lifting or adjusting in order to ensure its safety.</p><p> The LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended.</p><p> We found the mounting setup process to be straightforward for an afternoon DIY project. When choosing a wall mount, be sure to consider your individual needs as not all mounts are compatible with all building materials. If you have a plaster or masonry, for instance, you’re going to need stronger hardware than a typical mount has to offer. If you have drywall then the majority of TV mounts will be compatible with your home.</p><p> The other important factor when selecting a mount is the weight and screen size the mount is capable of holding. In this case, these measurements are 65 inches and 56 pounds. After this, considerations are based on preferences rather than hardware limitations. Do you want your mount to be fixed or flexible? Would you prefer installing the TV at eye level or would you like it to rest higher? Will you be placing it in a corner or on a flat wall? These are important questions to ask because they influence the kind of mount you’ll bring home. When in doubt, most manufacturers include a compatibility check for the TV’s make and model on their website. If you’re not comfortable measuring, leveling, and drilling into studs, it’s well worth the peace of mind to hire a handyman once you’ve made your selection.</p><p> Once the TV has been installed, LG’s WebOS guides the first-time setup process by prompting inputs for settings ranging from time zone and language up to and including any necessary user agreements. The LG C9 will complete a scan in order to identify the devices and then you’re free to customize the TV’s settings by pressing the gear button on the LG Magic Remote. The first setting we changed was the Auto Power Saving (APS) picture mode, which reduces power use by dimming the brightness of the TV. The other important setting to disable is TruMotion, which smooths motion in TV shows and movies by altering the frame rate of the programming. If your LG’s picture looks a bit too much like a soap opera, chances are you need to disable this setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012415/19272" target="_top" id="2012415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012415/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Stunning-picture"><a href="#Image-Quality-Stunning-picture" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Stunning picture"></a><strong>Image Quality: Stunning picture</strong></h2><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off. Even from wide viewing angles, the 4K picture maintains its excellence, with limited washing out and color loss.</p><p> John Wick’s dynamic action scenes and stunning backdrops shine through in gorgeous, gritty detail in_Parabellum_ ; magical realism pops off the screen in Elton John’s biopic_Rocketman_ ; and the intricate wonders of the natural world appear in extraordinarily sharp detail in_Planet Earth II_ .</p><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off.</p><p> These pictures are further enhanced with LG’s α9 Gen 2 intelligent processor, new to 2019’s model. It excels at drawing out detail and correcting quality discrepancies within the picture, such as banding which creates textures and strips in areas of the screen that would otherwise be smooth. This is particularly important given the large screen size and high resolution. While it’s not as bright as an LED TV since it lacks backlighting, it doesn’t need it as the TV already possesses excellent color, a change here would risk washing out the inky blacks on the screen.</p><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-expected"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-expected" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than expected"></a><strong>Audio: Better than expected</strong></h2><p> While OLED TVs aren’t generally known for their great sound quality, the LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended. Audio in TV or movies is generally good, but it struggles to regulate loud and soft noises in a scene. Streaming Lizzo’s_Cuz I Love You_ on Spotify produces a surprising depth of sound, but it’s simply not comparable to a more robust system that a soundbar or home theater system would provide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SZUaFESJi6OZubIeLdK1e9L9FEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_04-c559e4cc6de64f0c8baf4470f883dd9e-4844a7694fb74eb2904f1128ba93f760.jpeg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136623/26400" target="_top" id="2136623">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136623" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136623/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Smooth and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Smooth and easy to use</strong></h2><p> As with earlier models, the LG WebOS powers the C9. It’s a user-friendly interface that makes navigating the TV incredibly smooth, enabling you to switch between apps and features built into the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease. Meanwhile, the LG Magic Remote can function as a traditional remote control, as a mouse would for a computer screen, or issue voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa, making navigating the menus second nature. While most major streaming services are already included (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, to name a few) it’s also possible to download additional apps through the LG store. The drawback to the store, however, is that the apps are somewhat limited in availability.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon’s Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things. These controls extend into your home as well, enabling you to make use of any basic home control features already in place like updating the temperature on your Nest Smart Thermostat. You simply choose which assistant you want at a given time by pressing either the Amazon button on the Magic Remote to toggle Alexa or the microphone button to toggle Google Assistant.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with Google Assistant as well as Amazon’s Alexa.

The LG C9 is a premium 4K TV that sits at the top of this curve, offering integrated smart technologies and excellent picture with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. As such, it comes at a premium price of $2,500 (Amazon) that exceeds the cost of many competitor models, but with so many additional features it’s worth the high price—even if it’s difficult to swallow.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R"><a href="#LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R" class="headerlink" title="LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R"></a><strong>LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R</strong></h2><p> It’s easy to see why the LG C9 is such an attractive model. Between its many bells and whistles, it offers superior quality at a premium price. For users looking for a more down-to-earth price point, QLED TV models offer great picture quality at a lower cost and are a major competitor for OLED models.</p><p> The Samsung 65-Inch Class Q60R (QN65Q60RAFXZA) is a QLED TV that relies on edge lighting behind its screen to transmit light. This light shines through quantum dots within the LED panel which then transmit color through to the screen and create a picture. This differs from the LG C9 model which toggles pixels on and off individually to create inkier blacks and better contrast. While this isn’t a deal breaker for the Q60R, it does mean that the LG C9 panel will have a little more punch since it’s better equipped to balance bright whites with darker blacks.</p><p> If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> The Q60R also uses Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby integration feels somewhat clunky. It’s not uncommon to repeat instructions when Bixby has difficulty understanding basic instructions. The other caveat to be aware of is that the picture does wash out slightly and lose color when looked at from wide viewing angles. If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> Unlike OLED models, QLED models aren’t prone to burn-in. This is a condition where discoloration occurs over a portion of the screen. This happens when OLED TVs are left on the same channel for extensive periods of time. The Q60R also doubles as an excellent gaming TV or monitor thanks to its variable refresh rates and low input lag which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate to that of the source. While the C9 also has a variable refresh rate and a low input lag, its variable refresh rate is only compatible with the Xbox One for now since nothing else uses HDMI 2.1 yet. Generally retailing for around $1,000, the Q60R is less than half the cost of the LG C9, making it a better choice for those concerned about price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-q60r-series-qled-4k-tv-review-4782061" >Samsung Q60R Series QLED 4K TV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An excellent TV you shouldn’t hesitate to buy if you value ease of use and superb image quality.</strong></p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED C9. That said, these improvements aren’t significant leaps, mainly coming from processor improvements and the addition of HDMI 2.1 ports. If you’re simply looking for the best TV from last year and price isn’t a consideration, look no further.

Shall we?</p><h3 id="1-Rhythm-and-Tempo"><a href="#1-Rhythm-and-Tempo" class="headerlink" title="1. Rhythm and Tempo"></a>1. Rhythm and Tempo</h3><p>The most significant thing to notice is the rhythm and tempo of the music. The instrumental music comes at different speeds. The piano, guitar, cello, guitar, violin, and harmonica can create nuisance and be slowed down as per the player. It is important to choose royalty-free instrumental music whose tempo syncs with the video.</p><h3 id="2-Content-Type-of-Video"><a href="#2-Content-Type-of-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. Content-Type of Video"></a>2. Content-Type of Video</h3><p>The type of content in the video is essential to be studied. It is because the right information will lead to the right choice. If the video content is a product promo or description, there is nothing wrong with going a little high with tempo. However, if the video genre is business-related, avoid MP3 instrumental music with more movement and energy.</p><h3 id="3-Targeted-Audience-and-their-Preference"><a href="#3-Targeted-Audience-and-their-Preference" class="headerlink" title="3.

Frequency and Tone"></a>4. Frequency and Tone</h3><p>The frequency and tone of the music matter with the video. If the video has more dialogues and talking, the users should pick the instrumental background music with the same notes as human voices. The emotional tones of the guitar, violin, cello, viola, and keyboard would help in this situation as they would complement the voice in the video.</p><h3 id="5-Video-Length"><a href="#5-Video-Length" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Length"></a>5. Video Length</h3><p>The video length is yet another important pointer while selecting copyright-free instrumental music. If the video is big, the instrumental background music to fill it won’t last long. Therefore, pick instrumental music that syncs with the video length. You can also use the 30 or 60 seconds loop version to continue the background instrumental track.</p><h3 id="6-Video-Message"><a href="#6-Video-Message" class="headerlink" title="6.

Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2.

A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="3.

In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism-2"><a href="#1-Minimalism-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements-2"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time-2"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time-2" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-2"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings-2"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust-2"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1265663">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1265663">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmartinic.evyy.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1265663%2F4482'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1265663/4482"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Animation-2"><a href="#7-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings-3"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust-3"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><h3 id="7-Animation-3"><a href="#7-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Animation"></a>7. Animation</h3><p>Static slides are too mainstream for today’s fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation.

You are missing out on audiences and profit if you constrain the publication of your book just into the form of paperbacks or eBooks. Nowadays, audiobooks actually make more sense with a large number of audiobook listeners worldwide.</p><p>Here are some potential advantages of audiobooks and why you should learn how to create an audiobook:</p><h4 id="1-More-profit"><a href="#1-More-profit" class="headerlink" title="1.More profit"></a>1.More profit</h4><p>According to the latest pieces of research, most Americans prefer listening to audiobooks rather than reading an eBook. And as a result, the audiobook industry has now become very profitable.</p><p>Apart from the popularity, the cost of making an audiobook from an existing book is comparatively on the lower side. Therefore, the profit of converting books into audiobooks is pretty high.</p><h4 id="2-Larger-audience"><a href="#2-Larger-audience" class="headerlink" title="2.Larger audience"></a>2.Larger audience</h4><p>Audiobooks comparatively have a larger audience. The audience of audiobooks is not limited to those who are capable of reading. For example, a person with low or blind vision cannot read an eBook, but he can effortlessly listen to an audiobook. Likewise, an audiobook takes your piece of writing to a completely different and larger group of audience.</p><h4 id="3-No-worries-about-stock"><a href="#3-No-worries-about-stock" class="headerlink" title="3.No worries about stock"></a>3.No worries about stock</h4><p>When publishing a physical book, you have to constantly worry about keeping the print in stock and meeting readers’ demands.

Now the question is how to make an audiobook effortlessly. There are actually two ways in which you can create an audiobook.</p><ol><li>You can get the professional help of an audiobook production company.</li><li>Record the audiobook yourself.</li></ol><p>At first thought, you may feel like recording the audiobook yourself will help you save the cost of the process. But actually, recording the audiobook yourself will be more expensive in terms of money and time.</p><p>Anyways, let us see the basic steps of the creation of an audiobook.</p><ul><li>**Step One:**Prepare the contents of your book for recording. If it is an eBook, better delete the hyperlinks, visuals, and call to action that may cause distractions to the narrator. Ensure that the content or script can be easily read and makes some sense when listened to as an audiobook.</li><li>**Step Two:**Find a narrator. It can be yourself or someone hired for the purpose. You can actually hire an audiobook narrator for the purpose. Surprisingly, audiobook narrators are super-affordable, and they will get the task done effortlessly.</li><li>**Step Three:**Get the audio files recorded by the narrator mastered or edited by an audiobook producer to ensure the quality of the final production file. You can do it yourself if your technical knowledge is sound and good enough.</li><li><strong>Step Four:</strong> Now, the last step is uploading your audiobook into ACX or Audiobook Creation Exchange.</li></ul><p>And that is how an audiobook is created. By uploading on ACX, you can make your audiobook available and discoverable on most audiobook platforms, including Amazon, Apple audiobook store, and Audible.</p><p>You have to open an account on ACX to upload your audiobook. An ACX account can be easily created by entering your Amazon account and tax details. After signing up, you have to choose whether you need an exclusive publication or a non-exclusive publication for your audiobook.</p><p>Exclusive publication of your audiobook allows you to get a higher commission or royalty share of 40%. But your audiobook won’t be published on other competing sites. In contrast, your audiobook will get published on multiple sites if you choose a non-exclusive publication. But the royalty share reduces to just 25%.

Therefore, the profit of converting books into audiobooks is pretty high.</p><h4 id="2-Larger-audience-3"><a href="#2-Larger-audience-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Larger audience"></a>2.Larger audience</h4><p>Audiobooks comparatively have a larger audience. The audience of audiobooks is not limited to those who are capable of reading. For example, a person with low or blind vision cannot read an eBook, but he can effortlessly listen to an audiobook. Likewise, an audiobook takes your piece of writing to a completely different and larger group of audience.</p><h4 id="3-No-worries-about-stock-3"><a href="#3-No-worries-about-stock-3" class="headerlink" title="3.No worries about stock"></a>3.No worries about stock</h4><p>When publishing a physical book, you have to constantly worry about keeping the print in stock and meeting readers’ demands. You can avoid such worries when you opt for audiobooks. In the case of audiobooks, there always exists a file accessible for readers to download and read.</p><h4 id="4-Easy-discovery-3"><a href="#4-Easy-discovery-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Easy discovery"></a>4.Easy discovery</h4><p>Your book will become easily discoverable when you publish it in the version of an audiobook also. Printed books are comparatively least discoverable online unless they have an audiobook version. The more discoverable your book is, the more is its reach to the targeted audience.</p><h4 id="5-Save-on-time-and-expenses-3"><a href="#5-Save-on-time-and-expenses-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Save on time and expenses"></a>5.Save on time and expenses</h4><p>The creation of audiobooks is comparatively easy and low in cost. You can either hire services like ACX and Audiobook Creation Exchange. Or else, you can nowadays also create audiobooks on your own by using online programs such as Filmii.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-an-Audiobook-Effortlessly-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-an-Audiobook-Effortlessly-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create an Audiobook Effortlessly?"></a>Part 2: How To Create an Audiobook Effortlessly?</h2><p>We have seen the advantages of transferring your book into audiobook format in the last section. Now the question is how to make an audiobook effortlessly. There are actually two ways in which you can create an audiobook.</p><ol><li>You can get the professional help of an audiobook production company.</li><li>Record the audiobook yourself.</li></ol><p>At first thought, you may feel like recording the audiobook yourself will help you save the cost of the process. But actually, recording the audiobook yourself will be more expensive in terms of money and time.</p><p>Anyways, let us see the basic steps of the creation of an audiobook.</p><ul><li>**Step One:**Prepare the contents of your book for recording. If it is an eBook, better delete the hyperlinks, visuals, and call to action that may cause distractions to the narrator. Ensure that the content or script can be easily read and makes some sense when listened to as an audiobook.</li><li>**Step Two:**Find a narrator. It can be yourself or someone hired for the purpose. You can actually hire an audiobook narrator for the purpose. Surprisingly, audiobook narrators are super-affordable, and they will get the task done effortlessly.</li><li>**Step Three:**Get the audio files recorded by the narrator mastered or edited by an audiobook producer to ensure the quality of the final production file. You can do it yourself if your technical knowledge is sound and good enough.</li><li><strong>Step Four:</strong> Now, the last step is uploading your audiobook into ACX or Audiobook Creation Exchange.</li></ul><p>And that is how an audiobook is created. By uploading on ACX, you can make your audiobook available and discoverable on most audiobook platforms, including Amazon, Apple audiobook store, and Audible.</p><p>You have to open an account on ACX to upload your audiobook. An ACX account can be easily created by entering your Amazon account and tax details. After signing up, you have to choose whether you need an exclusive publication or a non-exclusive publication for your audiobook.</p><p>Exclusive publication of your audiobook allows you to get a higher commission or royalty share of 40%. But your audiobook won’t be published on other competing sites. In contrast, your audiobook will get published on multiple sites if you choose a non-exclusive publication. But the royalty share reduces to just 25%. That’s all about ACX.</p><p>Now let us see how to make an audiobook of your own.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Audiobook-Creatively-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Audiobook-Creatively-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Your Own Audiobook Creatively?"></a>Part 3: How to Make Your Own Audiobook Creatively?</h2><p>Most people don’t convert their books to audiobooks mainly for two reasons.

One of the most common problems we face is that our volumes are not normalized, and we need to take some extra time in order to achieve the best result for our audiences. Even with little or no knowledge about this very specific topic, we need to inform ourselves and find the solutions, make our videos more watch-able and our audios more listen-able, so to say.</p><p>There are several ways the audio normalization is achieved. One type is called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; the second is loudness normalization, adjusting the recording based on perceived loudness. RMS (Root-Mean-Square) changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p><p>Mostly, there are two reasons why we should give audio normalization a try. You need to decide yourself, what is your reason and expected outcome when you use audio normalization. First is when your aim is to get the maximum volume, but the second boils down to matching different volumes with each other.</p><p>When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.</p><p>More concretely, in general, audio normalization is when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, “the norm” for the project. It means that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.</p><p>You can have the desired result using different kinds of software. Nowadays, a lot of programs offer you the tool which facilitates this process. So, one of them would be DaVinci Resolve, which we are going to discuss in this article.</p><p>What is DaVinci Resolve? The description goes: “DaVinci Resolve is the world’s only solution that combines editing, color correction, visual effects, motion graphics and audio post production all in one software tool!” so, let’s discover what this software can do to help us balance the audio!</p><p>So, how to balance your audio in DaVinci Resolve? We are going to discuss everything step by step – how to set your target loudness level, how to monitor the loudness, and how you can use the automation feature.</p><p>Well, of course, have the program installed and opened. Then, add your video with the audio you want to edit or the audio separately, if that’s what you are aiming to do.</p><p>The first step you need to make is to set your target loudness level – for this, find the little settings button on the right bottom of the program and click on it. Now, go down to the Fairlight menu and change the Target Loudness Level. If you are doing the audio normalization for the Youtube content, then it is recommended to set it to -14 LUFS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-1.jpg"                      alt="set target loudness"                ></p><p>Next, you are going to head to the Fairlight page and make sure that your meters are open. the loudness meter is on the right top of the layout of the program, and it goes from +9 to -15 LUFS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-2.jpg"                      alt="make sure open the meters"                ></p><p>Here, zero represents exactly what our target loudness level is, in this case, as you remember, we set it to -14 LUFS. So, ensure that our loudness is as close as zero as possible on the meter, but you can also make it lower, such as -3. Whenever you play, you will be able to see that there are some numbers popping up to the right of the meter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-3.jpg"                      alt="set loudness as close as zero"                ></p><p>The first one, you’ll find, is Short – constantly changing, indicating how far above or below the target loudness level you are at a given time. Short Max tells you how far above or below your target loudness level the loudest point of your video is. Range is a measure of your quietest pick to your loudest peak, and the last one is Integrated – it gives you the overall loudness of your video in relation to your target loudness level. Integrated is the number we aim to keep around -3 or 0.</p><p>We can use our main slider (next to the sequence on the right) to make our video louder or quieter until we hit that target loudness level.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-4.jpg"                      alt="makee video louder or quieter"                ></p><p>Also, there is an automation tool that can help you dial in your loudness. In order to access this feature, find a red icon, looking like a wave with kind of a key frames.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-5.jpg"                      alt="automation tool help dial in loudness"                ></p><p>Next, open up your Index (on the far top panel, a little bit from the left), and make sure you are in the tracks menu in your editing index.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-6.jpg"                      alt="open index"                ></p><p>What you want to do is to make your main track visible on the timeline, so hit on the eyeball next to your main and go to your timeline, where you will expand your main track until you see your Loudness History options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-7.jpg"                      alt="make sure main track visible"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144298/7443" target="_top" id="2144298">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144298" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144298/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Here, you will need to check in the box next to Integrated and turn on the Loudness History.

Finding specific edit locations when editing footage or keyframing effects is made simpler by these characteristics. Audio waveforms in Final Cut Pro alter based on the volume of a clip or any applied effects. When the volume is high, the waveform is larger; when the volume is low, it is smaller. But when using FCP to edit video, people frequently experience issues with <strong>audio waveform disappearing</strong>. Or you do want to <strong>add some dynamic effects for audio waves</strong>?

In addition, photographers submit their images to the platform to allow others to reuse them.</p><p>Pexels’ free download policy allows you to obtain images under the Pexels or Creative common licensing rules. In addition, both licenses allow you to use Pexels images and videos for personal and commercial purposes, provided you make alterations to the original.</p><p>According to the site’s founders, the following are the reasons why the site is free:</p><ul><li>Its main source of revenue is selling advertisement slots to other paid-content databases.</li><li>You can also donate to the website’s operational costs with a single click. In addition, there is no limitation on how much and how often you can donate.</li><li>Most of the site’s contributors do so willingly to increase their brand exposure. For example, a verified user states that uploading his content to Pexels 4k and Pexels audio has resulted in an influx of high-paying customers.</li></ul><p>So, what is the difference between paid and stock photo sites? Paid content databases such as Shutterstock and Deposit photos require you to create a user ID and subscribe to their service. Conversely, stock photo sites like Pexels.com feature free stock images and videos that you can use with minimal restrictions.</p><p>For example, the site allows you to use its content on YouTube for personal or commercial reasons, provided you make adjustments to the original asset, and you own the video. In addition, the site’s library features content that its contributors share willingly. As such, you can download content from these sites without creating an account or acknowledging the image owner.</p><p>Currently, you can access Pexels through your web browser or download the app on your Android or iOS device.

They have a great soundtrack.</p><p>The music is what makes the montage video so special. The right song can make your montage video go viral, while the wrong one can make it fail miserably.</p><p>Here are some tips to help you pick the right music for your next montage:</p><h4 id="1-Choose-music-that-matches-the-mood-of-your-video"><a href="#1-Choose-music-that-matches-the-mood-of-your-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose music that matches the mood of your video"></a>1. Choose music that matches the mood of your video</h4><p>Many people make the mistake of choosing songs that don’t fit their videos at all. For example, if you’re making a movie about love and romance, it doesn’t make sense to use a heavy metal song about death and destruction. If you do, then your viewers will find it hard to connect with your movie because they will be distracted by the mismatch between what they see and what they hear.</p><h4 id="2-Pick-songs-that-match-the-genre-of-your-video"><a href="#2-Pick-songs-that-match-the-genre-of-your-video" class="headerlink" title="2.

Keep in mind that there are two types of songs - instrumental and vocal"></a>4. Keep in mind that there are two types of songs - instrumental and vocal</h4><p>Vocal songs have lyrics that can be sung along while listening to them, whereas instrumental ones don’t have any words but only music in them. It depends on what kind of effect you want to create in your audience’s minds when they listen to it. For example, if you want people to feel happy about something or if it’s about a celebration, then an instrumental one will work better than a vocal one because most people don’t like singing along with instrumental songs since they don’t know what the actual lyrics are.</p><h4 id="5-Think-about-the-emotions-you-want-to-convey"><a href="#5-Think-about-the-emotions-you-want-to-convey" class="headerlink" title="5. Think about the emotions you want to convey"></a>5. Think about the emotions you want to convey</h4><p>The most important thing when choosing a song is that it matches the emotion of your montage video. For example, if you want to express joyfulness, then you should choose a happy song with a rhythm that can bring up people’s spirits; if you want to express sadness, then you should choose a sad song with an emotional melody; if you want to express anger or hatred, then use heavy metal music; if you want to express love, then use romantic music; etc.</p><p>These are some tips to consider when adding music to your montage videos. Music is an important part of a video montage. It’s the second most important part after the video itself. A good song can make your montage more enjoyable and memorable.
