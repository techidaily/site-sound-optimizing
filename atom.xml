Every <strong>audio format</strong> that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.</p><p>In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:</p><ul><li>Uncompressed Audio Format</li><li>Lossless Compressed Audio Format</li><li>Lossy Compressed Audio Format</li></ul><p>Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:</p><h3 id="1-Uncompressed-Audio-Format"><a href="#1-Uncompressed-Audio-Format" class="headerlink" title="1. Uncompressed Audio Format"></a>1. Uncompressed Audio Format</h3><p>Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.</p><p>Some sound files that fall under this category include:</p><h4 id="1-Pulse-Code-Modulation-PCM"><a href="#1-Pulse-Code-Modulation-PCM" class="headerlink" title="1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)"></a>1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)</h4><p> A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.</p><h4 id="2-Waveform-Audio-File-Format-WAV"><a href="#2-Waveform-Audio-File-Format-WAV" class="headerlink" title="2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)"></a>2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)</h4><p> Generally used on the Windows platform, this <strong>audio format</strong> is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.</p><p><em>You may also interest: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube to WAV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</em></p><h4 id="3-Audio-Interchange-File-Format-AIFF"><a href="#3-Audio-Interchange-File-Format-AIFF" class="headerlink" title="3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)"></a>3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)</h4><p>AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.</p><p><em>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best AIFF to MP3 Converters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&gt;&gt;</em></p><h4 id="4-Data-Stream-Digital-DSD"><a href="#4-Data-Stream-Digital-DSD" class="headerlink" title="4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)"></a>4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)</h4><p>Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.</p><h3 id="2-Lossless-Compressed-Audio-Format"><a href="#2-Lossless-Compressed-Audio-Format" class="headerlink" title="2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format"></a>2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format</h3><p>Lossless Compressed <strong>audio format</strong> is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.</p><p>Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:</p><h4 id="1-Free-Lossless-Audio-Code-FLAC"><a href="#1-Free-Lossless-Audio-Code-FLAC" class="headerlink" title="1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)"></a>1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)</h4><p>At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free <strong>audio format</strong>, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.</p><p><em>Check some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best FLAC editor programs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&gt;&gt;</em></p><h4 id="2-Apple-Lossless-Audio-Codec-ALAC"><a href="#2-Apple-Lossless-Audio-Codec-ALAC" class="headerlink" title="2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)"></a>2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)</h4><p>Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.</p><h3 id="3-Lossy-Compressed-Audio-Format"><a href="#3-Lossy-Compressed-Audio-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format"></a>3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format</h3><p>These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.</p><p>Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:</p><h4 id="1-MPEG-1-Audio-Layer-3-MP3"><a href="#1-MPEG-1-Audio-Layer-3-MP3" class="headerlink" title="1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)"></a>1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)</h4><p>This is one of the most common file types and the <strong>best audio format</strong> for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the <strong>best audio file format</strong> is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.</p><p><em>Check this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >MP3 editor and convert video to MP3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> easily.</em></p><h4 id="2-OGG"><a href="#2-OGG" class="headerlink" title="2) OGG"></a>2) OGG</h4><p>This one, again, is not in fact an <strong>audio format</strong> but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.</p><h4 id="3-AU"><a href="#3-AU" class="headerlink" title="3) AU"></a>3) AU</h4><p>AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.</p><p>What’s the difference between common audio file formats like MP3,  WAV, and FLAC?

Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:</p><ul><li><strong>Uncompressed Audio</strong></li></ul><p>If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.</p><ul><li><strong>Lossless Compressed Audio</strong></li></ul><p>If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed <strong>audio format</strong> would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.</p><ul><li><strong>Compressed Audio</strong></li></ul><p>If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an <strong>audio format</strong> that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the <strong>best audio format</strong> that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Which-Audio-File-Formats-Does-YouTube-Support"><a href="#Part-3-Which-Audio-File-Formats-Does-YouTube-Support" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?"></a>Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?</h2><p>At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>MPEG-2</strong><ul><li><strong>Audio Bitrate:</strong> 128kbps or above</li><li><strong>Audio Codec:</strong> Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II</li></ul></li><li><strong>MPEG-4</strong><ul><li>**Video Codec:**264</li><li><strong>Audio Bitrate:</strong> 128kbps or above</li></ul></li></ul><p>Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Audio-Format-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-Audio-Format-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora"></a>Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora</h2><p>Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above.

Every <strong>audio format</strong> that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.</p><p>In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:</p><ul><li>Uncompressed Audio Format</li><li>Lossless Compressed Audio Format</li><li>Lossy Compressed Audio Format</li></ul><p>Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:</p><h3 id="1-Uncompressed-Audio-Format-2"><a href="#1-Uncompressed-Audio-Format-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Uncompressed Audio Format"></a>1. Uncompressed Audio Format</h3><p>Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.</p><p>Some sound files that fall under this category include:</p><h4 id="1-Pulse-Code-Modulation-PCM-2"><a href="#1-Pulse-Code-Modulation-PCM-2" class="headerlink" title="1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)"></a>1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)</h4><p> A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses.

Every <strong>audio format</strong> that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.</p><p>In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:</p><ul><li>Uncompressed Audio Format</li><li>Lossless Compressed Audio Format</li><li>Lossy Compressed Audio Format</li></ul><p>Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:</p><h3 id="1-Uncompressed-Audio-Format-3"><a href="#1-Uncompressed-Audio-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Uncompressed Audio Format"></a>1. Uncompressed Audio Format</h3><p>Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.</p><p>Some sound files that fall under this category include:</p><h4 id="1-Pulse-Code-Modulation-PCM-3"><a href="#1-Pulse-Code-Modulation-PCM-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)"></a>1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)</h4><p> A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.</p><h4 id="2-Waveform-Audio-File-Format-WAV-3"><a href="#2-Waveform-Audio-File-Format-WAV-3" class="headerlink" title="2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)"></a>2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)</h4><p> Generally used on the Windows platform, this <strong>audio format</strong> is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.</p><p><em>You may also interest: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube to WAV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</em></p><h4 id="3-Audio-Interchange-File-Format-AIFF-3"><a href="#3-Audio-Interchange-File-Format-AIFF-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)"></a>3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)</h4><p>AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.</p><p><em>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best AIFF to MP3 Converters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&gt;&gt;</em></p><h4 id="4-Data-Stream-Digital-DSD-3"><a href="#4-Data-Stream-Digital-DSD-3" class="headerlink" title="4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)"></a>4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)</h4><p>Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.</p><h3 id="2-Lossless-Compressed-Audio-Format-3"><a href="#2-Lossless-Compressed-Audio-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format"></a>2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format</h3><p>Lossless Compressed <strong>audio format</strong> is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.</p><p>Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:</p><h4 id="1-Free-Lossless-Audio-Code-FLAC-3"><a href="#1-Free-Lossless-Audio-Code-FLAC-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)"></a>1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)</h4><p>At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free <strong>audio format</strong>, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.</p><p><em>Check some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best FLAC editor programs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&gt;&gt;</em></p><h4 id="2-Apple-Lossless-Audio-Codec-ALAC-3"><a href="#2-Apple-Lossless-Audio-Codec-ALAC-3" class="headerlink" title="2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)"></a>2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)</h4><p>Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.</p><h3 id="3-Lossy-Compressed-Audio-Format-3"><a href="#3-Lossy-Compressed-Audio-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format"></a>3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format</h3><p>These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.</p><p>Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:</p><h4 id="1-MPEG-1-Audio-Layer-3-MP3-3"><a href="#1-MPEG-1-Audio-Layer-3-MP3-3" class="headerlink" title="1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)"></a>1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)</h4><p>This is one of the most common file types and the <strong>best audio format</strong> for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the <strong>best audio file format</strong> is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.</p><p><em>Check this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >MP3 editor and convert video to MP3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> easily.</em></p><h4 id="2-OGG-3"><a href="#2-OGG-3" class="headerlink" title="2) OGG"></a>2) OGG</h4><p>This one, again, is not in fact an <strong>audio format</strong> but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.</p><h4 id="3-AU-3"><a href="#3-AU-3" class="headerlink" title="3) AU"></a>3) AU</h4><p>AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.</p><p>What’s the difference between common audio file formats like MP3,  WAV, and FLAC?

Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:</p><ul><li><strong>Uncompressed Audio</strong></li></ul><p>If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.</p><ul><li><strong>Lossless Compressed Audio</strong></li></ul><p>If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed <strong>audio format</strong> would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.</p><ul><li><strong>Compressed Audio</strong></li></ul><p>If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an <strong>audio format</strong> that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the <strong>best audio format</strong> that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Which-Audio-File-Formats-Does-YouTube-Support-3"><a href="#Part-3-Which-Audio-File-Formats-Does-YouTube-Support-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?"></a>Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?</h2><p>At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>MPEG-2</strong><ul><li><strong>Audio Bitrate:</strong> 128kbps or above</li><li><strong>Audio Codec:</strong> Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II</li></ul></li><li><strong>MPEG-4</strong><ul><li>**Video Codec:**264</li><li><strong>Audio Bitrate:</strong> 128kbps or above</li></ul></li></ul><p>Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Audio-Format-in-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-4-Audio-Format-in-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora"></a>Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora</h2><p>Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above.

A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You don’t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it.

Soon after, the AI published its first oeuvre titled ‘Opus 1 for Piano Solo and in the subsequent years, AIVA released an album and composed music for a video game. Besides enabling its users to create music from scratch, AIVA can also be used to produce variations of existing songs. The music engine that powers this AI music composer makes the production of corporate or social media videos much easier, as it eliminates the need to go through the music licensing process.</p><h4 id="3-Jukedeck"><a href="#3-Jukedeck" class="headerlink" title="3.

Each track that is available through this AI music composer can be edited, so you can change its length or its tempo. You can create music with Jukedeck for free if you decide to give all the rights to the AI composer, while both individuals and small businesses can purchase the license to use the song created with Jukedeck for just $0.99.</p><p>Note: Jukedeck has been acquired by TikTok, and we are waiting for a new Jukedeck.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

However, you can’t use Brain.fm to create your own music, as this platform is better suited for people who spend a lot of time at work and have a tough time maintaining their focus while performing important tasks.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The opportunities AI music composers offer are still not properly explored, because most of these technologies are still under development. The results AI music composers we included in this article have managed to achieve so far are impressive because each of them can produce high-quality audio files for all sorts of video content. Which AI music composer do you like to use the most?

A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You don’t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it.

Soon after, the AI published its first oeuvre titled ‘Opus 1 for Piano Solo and in the subsequent years, AIVA released an album and composed music for a video game. Besides enabling its users to create music from scratch, AIVA can also be used to produce variations of existing songs. The music engine that powers this AI music composer makes the production of corporate or social media videos much easier, as it eliminates the need to go through the music licensing process.</p><h4 id="3-Jukedeck"><a href="#3-Jukedeck" class="headerlink" title="3.

Each track that is available through this AI music composer can be edited, so you can change its length or its tempo. You can create music with Jukedeck for free if you decide to give all the rights to the AI composer, while both individuals and small businesses can purchase the license to use the song created with Jukedeck for just $0.99.</p><p>Note: Jukedeck has been acquired by TikTok, and we are waiting for a new Jukedeck.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

When done, simply click on the Create Music button, and the platform will automatically generate the soundtrack for your video. In case you are producing videos on a constant basis, you should consider purchasing one of the available subscription plans.</p><h4 id="5-Melodrive"><a href="#5-Melodrive" class="headerlink" title="5.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-Affordable-Web-Platforms-for-Equalizing-Auditory-Content"><a href="#Best-Affordable-Web-Platforms-for-Equalizing-Auditory-Content" class="headerlink" title="Best Affordable Web Platforms for Equalizing Auditory Content"></a>Best Affordable Web Platforms for Equalizing Auditory Content</h2><p>What is Audio Normalization, what are its different types, why do we need it and how to do it online? – these are the questions we might ask when first learning about it. Well, then, let’s answer all of them!</p><p>Audio Normalization means that the loudest parts of an audio signal are set to a specific value. For example, -18 dBFS (decibels relative to full scale). This is done so that all the parts of the sound mix remain at equal volume levels.</p><p>You can use this tool when mixing or editing your music, or during playback on your speakers. In the case of mixing, listen for any clipping (A form of waveform distortion - It sounds like the audio is starting to ‘break up,’ which is light distortion. The more severe it is, the more distorted the music begins to sound) that could occur in your mix. So, in this case, you need to normalize before it becomes too loud and needs more and more fixing. So, normalizing the audio kind of means balancing the volume of the track.</p><p>Mostly, audio normalizers are used for balancing out the volume of music, podcast, or other audio recordings. Whenever you have a variety of audio clips that would sound too loud or soft if listened to together, an audio normalizer helps you create a more cohesive listening experience. So, why, and when, do we need to normalize our tracks?</p><ul><li>To make different music styles sound more cohesive;</li><li>To adjust the volume of podcast to be at a consistent level with one another</li><li>To remove sharp spikes in volume for consistent listening experience for our audiences</li></ul><p>So, what are the types of audio normalization? Here you have it:</p><ul><li><strong>peak normalization</strong> - helps adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording;</li><li><strong>loudness normalization</strong> - adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness;</li><li><strong>RMS (Root-Mean-Square)</strong> - changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</li></ul><p>So, say that if you are a creator and have listeners, with this tool, you can count on the expectation that people will more likely want to convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners. This is what happens when audiences feel their user experience is favored and they enjoy a good content – it makes them come back for more.</p><p>But sometimes you don’t have so much time that would allow you to find a software, download its installer, install it, learn how to navigate inside its interface, which might be totally new and in some cases, complicated for you, and learn how to normalize your audio files there. In this case, you might want to find the right tools which would enable you to reach your goal without even having to install anything – simple and fast!</p><p>Hence, for this case, we would like to offer you the list of 10 best free online audio normalizers. The list goes:</p><ol><li>MP3 Gain Volume Changer</li><li>Sodaphonic</li><li>Audio Mass</li><li>Audio Online Convert</li><li>Audio Editor</li><li>fConvert Online Converter</li><li>Boost MP3 Volume</li><li>MP3Cut Change Volume</li><li>Audio Alter Volume Changer</li><li>Audio Trimmer Volume Booster</li></ol><p>Therefore, let’s delve into each one of them, and learn how to use those online editors in our favor!</p><h2 id="MP3-Gain-Volume-Changer"><a href="#MP3-Gain-Volume-Changer" class="headerlink" title="MP3 Gain Volume Changer"></a>MP3 Gain Volume Changer</h2><p>This online editor allows you to adjust the volume level of MP3 audio files fast – it can raise, lower, and normalize the volume level of your MP3 files.</p><p>The interface is simple and easy to use – exactly what you must be looking for. You can adjust the volume level to make the MP3 the way you want to listen to it.</p><p>One of the important things this app is letting you do is to upload from Google Drive or Desktop – it works locally without going through a server, and this means that MP3s do not need to be uploaded to any server.</p><p>So, go to this <a class="link"   href="https://mp3gain.flowsoft7.com/" >link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Click on Choose Files and find the audio clip you would like to normalize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-1.jpg"                      alt="click on choose files"                ></p><p>Now, once your audio track is added, head a little below and find the options you have.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-2.jpg"                      alt="added audio track"                ></p><p>Here, you can decide what do really do with your file: do you want to increase or decrease the volume? If you choose automatic normalization, the app will figure something out itself! And, look at the right side – in case you know well your decibels, you can choose how many decibels to apply. But the web-site itself says that 3.0 decibels is recommended, so it would be nice to just stick with it.</p><p>If you have multiple files and you want to normalize them all at once, click on Create MP3 (All); in case you have a lot of files and you would like to normalize one or more of them but not all, then your best choice would be Create MP3 (Selected). Another option is that you save your file on Google Drive.</p><p>When you Create your file(s), the normalized one(s) will appear under those buttons in Progress Log, and you can Play right away, or Download and listen to it later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-3.jpg"                      alt="appear normalized file"                ></p><h2 id="Sodaphonic"><a href="#Sodaphonic" class="headerlink" title="Sodaphonic"></a>Sodaphonic</h2><p>Sodaphonic also lets you edit your audio files online. With the help of this editor, you can cut, copy, and paste sound segments of an audio.

Understanding Reverb: An Overview"></a>Part 1. Understanding Reverb: An Overview</h2><h3 id="What-is-reverb"><a href="#What-is-reverb" class="headerlink" title="What is reverb"></a>What is reverb</h3><p>Podcasting and music production commonly use reverb as a signal processing tool. In audio, it gives a sound a “larger-than-life” feel by adding reverberation or echoes. Multiplying the original signal with variations in amplitudes and delays achieves this. In addition to bringing life to a track, this creates a unique effect. “Echo” is also a term used in colloquial language.</p><p>Reverb and echo can ruin your production’s sound if they are used too much. Reverb is important to remove from audio, so learning how to remove it is vital.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/top-strategies-how-to-remove-reverb-from-audio-with-precision-1.jpg"                      alt="understanding reverb"                ></p><h3 id="How-does-reverb-happen-and-why-can-it-be-a-bit-of-a-problem"><a href="#How-does-reverb-happen-and-why-can-it-be-a-bit-of-a-problem" class="headerlink" title="How does reverb happen, and why can it be a bit of a problem?"></a>How does reverb happen, and why can it be a bit of a problem?</h3><p>Reverb occurs when sound waves bounce off walls, objects, or surfaces in an environment. Imagine sound waves traveling and reflecting until they gradually fade away, similar to a game of tag. Audio production can benefit and suffer from this natural phenomenon.</p><p>Recordings with reverb have a warm, spacious, and acoustic environment feel. Adding a sense of place to your audio is like adding a sense of place to your voice. A sonic mess can be created by too much reverb at the wrong places. You may have difficulty hearing the essential elements of your audio.</p><p>Recording vocals in a small room, for example, may require reducing or eliminating reverb. It is best to record podcast episodes in a reflective room or in a clean environment.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-Reverb-From-Audio-Online-With-Media-io-Step-By-Step"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-Reverb-From-Audio-Online-With-Media-io-Step-By-Step" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Understanding Reverb: An Overview"></a>Part 1. Understanding Reverb: An Overview</h2><h3 id="What-is-reverb-1"><a href="#What-is-reverb-1" class="headerlink" title="What is reverb"></a>What is reverb</h3><p>Podcasting and music production commonly use reverb as a signal processing tool. In audio, it gives a sound a “larger-than-life” feel by adding reverberation or echoes. Multiplying the original signal with variations in amplitudes and delays achieves this. In addition to bringing life to a track, this creates a unique effect. “Echo” is also a term used in colloquial language.</p><p>Reverb and echo can ruin your production’s sound if they are used too much. Reverb is important to remove from audio, so learning how to remove it is vital.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/top-strategies-how-to-remove-reverb-from-audio-with-precision-1.jpg"                      alt="understanding reverb"                ></p><h3 id="How-does-reverb-happen-and-why-can-it-be-a-bit-of-a-problem-1"><a href="#How-does-reverb-happen-and-why-can-it-be-a-bit-of-a-problem-1" class="headerlink" title="How does reverb happen, and why can it be a bit of a problem?"></a>How does reverb happen, and why can it be a bit of a problem?</h3><p>Reverb occurs when sound waves bounce off walls, objects, or surfaces in an environment. Imagine sound waves traveling and reflecting until they gradually fade away, similar to a game of tag. Audio production can benefit and suffer from this natural phenomenon.</p><p>Recordings with reverb have a warm, spacious, and acoustic environment feel. Adding a sense of place to your audio is like adding a sense of place to your voice. A sonic mess can be created by too much reverb at the wrong places. You may have difficulty hearing the essential elements of your audio.</p><p>Recording vocals in a small room, for example, may require reducing or eliminating reverb. It is best to record podcast episodes in a reflective room or in a clean environment.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-Reverb-From-Audio-Online-With-Media-io-Step-By-Step-1"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-Reverb-From-Audio-Online-With-Media-io-Step-By-Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Creating a new audio file from a video clip is a routine operation that enables you to combine the sound of one clip with any number of video clips you include in your projects or use it as a separate audio file. You don’t even need a desktop-based video editing software to extract audio from video files since a growing number of online platforms offer this service for free. That’s why, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online tools that allow you to separate audio from video files in just a few easy steps.</p><h2 id="Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors"><a href="#Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Online Audio Extractors"></a>Top 6 Online Audio Extractors</h2><p>The limitations in terms of size and file format can narrow down your choices of online audio extractors. So, before you decide which platform you are going to use, you must first check the size and file format of your video. Let’s take a look at some of the best online audio extractors you can use to create high-quality audio files for free.</p><h4 id="2-Online-Audio-Converter"><a href="#2-Online-Audio-Converter" class="headerlink" title="2. Online Audio Converter"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://online-audio-converter.com/" >Online Audio Converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The wide range of supported file formats, as well as the straightforward audio extraction process, make this platform one the best choices for anyone who wants to create an audio file from a video. The maximum size of the video file you can upload to Online Audio Converter is <strong>2048mb</strong>, which means that you can even convert high-resolution files that last more than just a few minutes. Once you’ve uploaded a video file from your computer, <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or some other online destination, you just have to select the <strong>output format</strong> and <strong>the quality</strong> of the audio file. Optionally, you can click on <strong>the Advanced settings option</strong> if you would like to add <strong>fade in and fade out effects</strong>, try to <strong>remove voice</strong> or change the <strong>bitrates and sample rates</strong>. Click on the <strong>Convert button</strong> when ready and proceed to <strong>save the file</strong> to your computer or at some online destination.</p><h4 id="3-AudioExtracter"><a href="#3-AudioExtracter" class="headerlink" title="3. AudioExtracter"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://audio-extractor.net/" >AudioExtracter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This platform enables you to convert video files to audio files <strong>automatically</strong>, but it also offers a variety of <strong>video, photo and audio editing tools</strong> you can use free of charge. You just have to upload a file, in <strong>MP4, AVI</strong> or any other commonly used video file formats, that is smaller than <strong>500mb</strong> and AudioExtracter will convert your video into an MP3 audio file you can save to your computer. The only downside is that you can’t choose an <strong>output format, readjust the bitrate and select the quality of the audio file</strong> you are creating, which can significantly restrict your options. The platform also offers a new feature that enables you to <strong>convert YouTube videos into MP3 files,</strong> so that you can save all your favorite songs as audio files on your computer.</p><h4 id="4-Online-Video-Converter"><a href="#4-Online-Video-Converter" class="headerlink" title="4.

The audio extraction process is rather simple as you just have to <strong>upload the file</strong> and wait for the platform to prepare your file for conversion. Afterward, you just have to <strong>select the output format</strong> and click on the <strong>Start button</strong> and once the conversion process is completed, you can save the file to a destination on your device or use the <strong>QR code</strong> to download it to a <strong>Smartphone or tablet</strong>. What’s more, you can also use the <strong>Online Video Converter</strong> to extract audio files from <a class="link"   href="https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/mp3-converter" >YouTube videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Simply paste the video’s URL and then proceeds to choose the output format, and click on the <strong>More Settings</strong> option if you want to designate <strong>the start and end points</strong> of the new audio file. Click on the <strong>Start button</strong> to commence the extraction process and use one of the available methods to download the file.</p><h4 id="5-Video2Mp3"><a href="#5-Video2Mp3" class="headerlink" title="5. Video2Mp3"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://video2mp3.net/en/" >Video2Mp3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>YouTubers who already have channels on the world’s largest video sharing platform can use the Video2Mp3 tool to turn their videos into MP3 files effortlessly. You don’t even have to be a registered YouTube user to convert videos stored on this platform with Video2Mp3, because you can just pick any video that is uploaded to YouTube and turn it into an MP3 file with this powerful audio extraction tool. Once you’ve pasted the video’s <strong>URL into the platform’s URL box</strong>, simply click on the Convert to MP3 button. You will then have to specify the preferred <strong>output format</strong>, or use the platform’s <strong>Search and Convert</strong> option that lets you search for videos on <strong>Dailymotion, Clipfish or YouTube</strong> and convert them. Click on the <strong>Convert button</strong> to initiate the conversion process, <strong>insert the name of the artist and title</strong> of the song you’re converting and proceed to download the video.</p><h4 id="6-Zamzar"><a href="#6-Zamzar" class="headerlink" title="6. Zamzar"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zamzar.com/" >Zamzar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>You can convert a video file with Zamzar in just three quick steps, upload a file from an online destination or from your device, <strong>pick the output format</strong> and click on the Convert button. Once the file is converted you can save it to your computer, however, the free version of the Zamzar platform offers only limited options. In case you would like to be able to convert files that are <strong>larger than 200mb</strong>, be able to <strong>convert via email</strong>, have access to <strong>online storage space</strong>, then you should <strong>choose one of the available subscription plans</strong>. Keep in mind that all versions of the platform <strong>limit the concurrent number of conversions</strong>, which means that even if you purchase a subscription plan, you are going to be able to make <strong>25, 50 or 100</strong> concurrent conversions each month, depending on the plan you choose.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Audio Recording Software to Capture Your Voice Easily <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Creating audio files from videos you record with your phones and digital cameras doesn’t require a lot of effort since online audio extractors enable you to complete the entire process in just a couple of minutes.

Everyone, especially in this digital world, is trying to make their content as clean as possible, without impurities, for the audiences to watch, enjoy, and stay with the creators. So, you might find it really uncomfortable when you are in this kind of situation. But what you can do, is doable – you can depend on a video denoise software!</p><p>There are a lot of online or offline tools you could use to do that, and we have discussed a lot of them on our web-site, and now, we will review yet another way to achieve your desired result when it comes to noise and grain. So, in today’s article, we will touch upon how to AI DeNoise your image!</p><p>The case with this intelligent noise reduction for 2022 is that noise reduction software has been the same for over a decade. This is when DeNoise AI comes to play, because its approach is something new – it uses deep learning. The process is lengthy and focuses on learning millions of images, thus let DeNoise AI to accurately distinguish between real image detail and noise. This is so important because with this new technique, now it is possible to denoise images while actually recovering important detail, something that was impossible a few years ago.</p><p>Topaz DeNoise AI has a very simple and intuitive interface with different noise removal options. Anyway, using it in the most effective way would require some knowledge. Oh, and, it would be a headache if you have a slow computer!..</p><p>So, as mentioned, traditional noise reduction software most of the time reduces the original detail in the images, but DeNoise AI’s noise reduction eliminates noise, meanwhile, preserves the detail and even enhances it. The new update of Topaz DeNoise AI offers different advanced DeNoise AI Models that can be integrated perfectly into your workflow; you can use it as a standalone piece of software or as a plugin for Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom.</p><h2 id="How-to-AI-DeNoise-a-file"><a href="#How-to-AI-DeNoise-a-file" class="headerlink" title="How to AI DeNoise a file"></a>How to AI DeNoise a file</h2><p>Let’s just suppose you don’t have the software. So, download and install Topaz DeNoise AI. Go to Topaz Labs and select your operating system: Windows or Macintosh OS. Then, install the program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-1.jpg"                      alt="download and install topaz denoise ai"                ></p><p>Once the installation is finished, you will be able to see the Topaz DeNoise AI icon among your applications. Topaz DeNoise AI plugins for Lightroom or Photoshop would also be added there automatically, without any further intervention. But, if that is not the case, it’s ok to add them manually.</p><p>The first time you open Topaz DeNoise AI, you can either log in with your Topaz Labs account or try the Denoise AI 30-day free trial.</p><p>So, let’s discover how to use DeNoise AI in its different versions!</p><p><strong>First, how to remove digital noise with DeNoise AI:</strong> DeNoise AI supports most of the commonly used photography files like raw files, dng, tiff, jpegs, etc. So, open the program, drag or open your image and select the best AI model.</p><p>In the upper right corner, you will find a toolbar with these options:</p><p><strong>Preview Options:</strong></p><p>To change the view mode of the photo you’re working with, you can select:</p><ul><li>Original (original photo preview)</li><li>Single (denoised photo preview).</li><li>Split (Original and denoised photo preview with a split slider)</li><li>Side by Side ( Original and denoised photo preview)</li><li>Comparison ( Compare how the different Ai Models work in your photos at the same time).</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom</strong></p><p>Zoom in on your images to accurately check the process’s progress.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-2.jpg"                      alt="zoom in on images"                ></p><p>Denoise AI full review and tutorial</p><p>On the right side, you’ll find:</p><ul><li>A navigator with the selected zoom box.</li><li>A list with the following DeNoise AI Models:</li><li>Standard: Broadly developed noise reduction that maintains detail.</li><li>Clear: Best for photos with smooth and rounded surfaces such as skin, rocks, water, etc.</li><li>Low light: Best for low-light conditions and heavy noise</li><li>Severe noise: Best for extremely noisy photos</li><li>Raw: The newest AI model in DeNoise. It provides excellent noise reduction, preserving detail, and authentic color starting from a RAW file.</li><li>Main Settings. The Auto mode works great in most situations. However, it can be pretty aggressive and give your photos a washed-out look. With Manual Mode, you can set the adjustments according to your taste.</li><li>The Post-processing sliders help reduce any color noise remaining in your photos and preserve original detail.</li><li>Save Image: To set your output settings before saving your images.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-3.jpg"                      alt="set output settings"                ></p><p>Then, adjust the setting sliders (you can just select Auto mode here); now, apply the adjustments locally, if necessary, using the mask tool; and, save the file with the output settings selected.</p><p><strong>Second, let’ts move to DeNoise AI workflow.</strong></p><p>If you are trying to find the simplest way to start with DeNoise Ai, it’s better to use the suggested mode, - Light bulb icon! This will automatically select an AI model, and will do so based oon your image. Anyway, in order to remove digital noise there, it’s the best to use the updated comparison view. The reason is obvious – you can take a look right away and compare varied AI models, or the same ones with some different settings to your liking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-4.jpg"                      alt="use light bulb icon"                ></p><p>So, how to do just that? Well, select the AI model and fine-tune the adjustment using the following settings:</p><ul><li>Remove Noise: This slider is wonderful!. It removes the noise in your photo, but doesn’t kind of wash out the images. Values between 10-50 are the best in most cases.</li><li>Enhance Sharpness: It sharpens and recovers the detail in images that may become a bit blurry after denoising. It would be excessive if you set the values over 30, in case you would like to avoid odd textures.</li></ul><p>After that, you can refine your results with these DeNoise AI Post-processing adjustments:</p><ul><li>Recover Original Detail: It helps recover some detail that has been washed out after the noise reduction and adds a bit of grain to keep the image natural. 20-40 points is more than enough.</li><li>Color Noise Reduction: This is a powerful tool that reduces any color noise remaining in your images. Zoom in on a dark area and adjust the slider until the color noise disappears and you are happy with the result!</li></ul><p><strong>And, the last topic to discuss is DeNoise AI Masking Tool!</strong> The software includes a very simple Mask tool in case you want to denoise the image only in certain areas and not in others. So, the key here is that DeNoise AI will apply your adjustments only to the areas that you paint in red.</p><p>You need to ckeck the Overlay tool to see the red color while painting. When you are satisfied with the areas you panted, After painting over these areas, you will see a preview of your mask in black and white. Here, white shows the adjustments while black hides them. Following this, DeNoise AI will just be applied to the areas painted in white.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-5.jpg"                      alt="check overlay tool"                ></p><p>And, the masking settings are:</p><ul><li>Add&#x2F;Subtract: to paint in white or black and reveal or hide your adjustments.</li><li>Size: to change the size of your brush.</li><li>Softness: to change the hardness of your brush. Being 0 is the hardest and 100 the softest.</li><li>Opacity: to vary the opacity of the mask to add precise local adjustments.</li><li>Mask options: to clear or invert your mask.</li><li>Overlay: to show in red these areas where you are painting.</li></ul><p>Once you finish creating your mask, just click on the “apply mask” button, and there you go!</p><h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora-X"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-X" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora X"></a>Wondershare Filmora X</h2><p>Even though we discussed in so much detail how to DeNoise AI our images, it’s important to keep in mind that even videos need denoising.

Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy.

Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.</p><p>On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?"></a>Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries. Several applications offer sound editing tools to serve the needs of the people. Pitch-changing is one of the common tools that people look for in sound editors.</p><p>Audacity is one of the notable software that allows users to change the pitch of the voice. It comes with an <strong>Audacity pitch shift</strong> mechanism to facilitate users. So, if you are editing sound in Audacity, changing the pitch is just a matter of a few clicks. Are you still wondering how you can apply the <strong>Audacity change pitch</strong> technique when editing? Here’s how you can do it in simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Select the audio portion</strong></p><p>Launch Audacity and add sound recordings you want to edit.

The AudioRemover tool is quite simple to use, as you just have to click on the <strong>Browse button</strong> to select the video you’d like to upload and then click on the <strong>Upload Video button</strong> to start removing the audio from video. The entire process is automatic, so once the upload is over you can just click on the <strong>Download File link</strong> to save the new file to your computer. You can’t upload files larger than <strong>500MB</strong> to AudioRemover which can potentially reduce the number of options you have at your disposal. The platform replaces the entire audio of a video clip and it doesn’t allow you to remove only a part of the video’s original sound.</p><h4 id="3-Audio-Extractor"><a href="#3-Audio-Extractor" class="headerlink" title="3.

You just have to <strong>upload a video file</strong> to the platform from your computer or from the Google Drive, <strong>select MP3, FLAC or OGG</strong> output audio format and click on the <strong>Extract Audio button</strong>. You can then save the audio file on <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or download it to your computer. The 123apps platform also offers Audio Cutter, Audio Converter and Voice Recorder tools you can use to edit an audio file online or add narration to your videos. However, Audio-Extractor isn’t the best option for removing audio from videos, since it only allows you to save audio files, which means that you can’t create a video that doesn’t contain sound with this tool.</p><h4 id="4-Kapwing"><a href="#4-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="4.

After you upload a video to the platform, you’ll be able to preview it without sound, and if you like the result you can click on the <strong>Create button</strong>. Generating a muted file can take a while, depending on how long is the video, but once the process is completed, you can click on the <strong>Download button</strong> to save the video to your computer or the <strong>Edit button</strong> if you want to go through all the steps of muting a video again.

Click on the <strong>Upload&amp;Convert</strong> button and wait for the video file to be processed. When the file is converted you can save the new video or audio file to a destination on your hard drive.

Select the video you’d like to mute and then go the <strong>Creator Studio’s Video tab</strong>. Once the options Video tab has to offer are displayed on the screen you should click on the <strong>Audio tab</strong>, that is located at the top of the screen next to <strong>Enhancements and End Screen and Annotations tabs</strong>. When the new tab opens you’ll notice that there is no option to remove audio from a video, but you can change the <strong>Featured Tracks</strong> option to <strong>Ambient</strong> and then select one of the available tracks in the menu below. The <strong>Favor Original Audio</strong> slider that is located below the preview window lets you control how much the new track is going to impact the video’s original sound. <strong>Drag the slider all the way to the right</strong> in order to avoid bringing back the original audio and then click on <strong>the Position Audio option</strong> to gain access to <strong>the audio waveform</strong>. <strong>Drag the slider located on the right side of the waveform all the way to the left to trim the duration of the new audio to approximately one second</strong> and the video will no longer have sound. <strong>This audio editing technique won’t work if you trim the new audio to zero</strong>, which is why it is important to <strong>carefully set the duration of the new audio track</strong> you added to the video. Click on the <strong>Save as New Video option</strong> to confirm the changes you’ve made and that’s it you successfully used YouTube to remove audio from a video.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Extracting or muting a video online is easy since you just have to upload a video file and the online tool you’ve chosen for this task will do the rest for you.

Furthermore, how long the upload is going to last depends on the size of the file, so it is advisable to choose a video that is small in size in order to avoid wasting a lot of time on waiting for the file to upload. Here’s how you can remove audio from videos online.</p><h4 id="2-AudioRemover-1"><a href="#2-AudioRemover-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

The AudioRemover tool is quite simple to use, as you just have to click on the <strong>Browse button</strong> to select the video you’d like to upload and then click on the <strong>Upload Video button</strong> to start removing the audio from video. The entire process is automatic, so once the upload is over you can just click on the <strong>Download File link</strong> to save the new file to your computer. You can’t upload files larger than <strong>500MB</strong> to AudioRemover which can potentially reduce the number of options you have at your disposal. The platform replaces the entire audio of a video clip and it doesn’t allow you to remove only a part of the video’s original sound.</p><h4 id="3-Audio-Extractor-1"><a href="#3-Audio-Extractor-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

You just have to <strong>upload a video file</strong> to the platform from your computer or from the Google Drive, <strong>select MP3, FLAC or OGG</strong> output audio format and click on the <strong>Extract Audio button</strong>. You can then save the audio file on <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or download it to your computer. The 123apps platform also offers Audio Cutter, Audio Converter and Voice Recorder tools you can use to edit an audio file online or add narration to your videos. However, Audio-Extractor isn’t the best option for removing audio from videos, since it only allows you to save audio files, which means that you can’t create a video that doesn’t contain sound with this tool.</p><h4 id="4-Kapwing-1"><a href="#4-Kapwing-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

The Mute Video tool reduces the video’s audio volume to zero automatically, which for all practical purposes is the same as removing an audio file from a video. After you upload a video to the platform, you’ll be able to preview it without sound, and if you like the result you can click on the <strong>Create button</strong>. Generating a muted file can take a while, depending on how long is the video, but once the process is completed, you can click on the <strong>Download button</strong> to save the video to your computer or the <strong>Edit button</strong> if you want to go through all the steps of muting a video again.

Click on the <strong>Choose File button</strong> and then select either <strong>Remove Sound or Extract Sound</strong> option. If you want to <strong>Extract Sound</strong> the platform lets you choose from <strong>MP3, iPhone ringtone or wav</strong> output audio file formats. Click on the <strong>Upload&amp;Convert</strong> button and wait for the video file to be processed. When the file is converted you can save the new video or audio file to a destination on your hard drive. However, the platform requests your <strong>mobile phone number</strong> before you can download a file and it <strong>displays ads</strong> after you click on the <strong>Download button</strong>, which can be quite frustrating if you want to remove audio from a video clip quickly.</p><h4 id="6-Using-YouTube-to-Remove-Audio-From-Videos-1"><a href="#6-Using-YouTube-to-Remove-Audio-From-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

Select the video you’d like to mute and then go the <strong>Creator Studio’s Video tab</strong>. Once the options Video tab has to offer are displayed on the screen you should click on the <strong>Audio tab</strong>, that is located at the top of the screen next to <strong>Enhancements and End Screen and Annotations tabs</strong>. When the new tab opens you’ll notice that there is no option to remove audio from a video, but you can change the <strong>Featured Tracks</strong> option to <strong>Ambient</strong> and then select one of the available tracks in the menu below. The <strong>Favor Original Audio</strong> slider that is located below the preview window lets you control how much the new track is going to impact the video’s original sound. <strong>Drag the slider all the way to the right</strong> in order to avoid bringing back the original audio and then click on <strong>the Position Audio option</strong> to gain access to <strong>the audio waveform</strong>. <strong>Drag the slider located on the right side of the waveform all the way to the left to trim the duration of the new audio to approximately one second</strong> and the video will no longer have sound. <strong>This audio editing technique won’t work if you trim the new audio to zero</strong>, which is why it is important to <strong>carefully set the duration of the new audio track</strong> you added to the video. Click on the <strong>Save as New Video option</strong> to confirm the changes you’ve made and that’s it you successfully used YouTube to remove audio from a video.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Extracting or muting a video online is easy since you just have to upload a video file and the online tool you’ve chosen for this task will do the rest for you.

The AudioRemover tool is quite simple to use, as you just have to click on the <strong>Browse button</strong> to select the video you’d like to upload and then click on the <strong>Upload Video button</strong> to start removing the audio from video. The entire process is automatic, so once the upload is over you can just click on the <strong>Download File link</strong> to save the new file to your computer. You can’t upload files larger than <strong>500MB</strong> to AudioRemover which can potentially reduce the number of options you have at your disposal. The platform replaces the entire audio of a video clip and it doesn’t allow you to remove only a part of the video’s original sound.</p><h4 id="3-Audio-Extractor-3"><a href="#3-Audio-Extractor-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Audio-Extractor"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://audio-extractor.net/" >Audio-Extractor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-extractor-online-audio-remover.jpg"                      alt="online audio remover.jpg"                ></p><p>If you would like to separate the audio from a video, the Audio-Extractor tool is one of the best options available on the Internet. You just have to <strong>upload a video file</strong> to the platform from your computer or from the Google Drive, <strong>select MP3, FLAC or OGG</strong> output audio format and click on the <strong>Extract Audio button</strong>. You can then save the audio file on <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or download it to your computer. The 123apps platform also offers Audio Cutter, Audio Converter and Voice Recorder tools you can use to edit an audio file online or add narration to your videos. However, Audio-Extractor isn’t the best option for removing audio from videos, since it only allows you to save audio files, which means that you can’t create a video that doesn’t contain sound with this tool.</p><h4 id="4-Kapwing-3"><a href="#4-Kapwing-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Kapwing"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/mute-video" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-remove-audio-from-video.jpg"                      alt="online audio remover.jpg"                ></p><p>Kapwing is an online video editing platform that lets you add text or music to videos, change the playback speed of a video or create memes and stop-motion animations. The Mute Video tool reduces the video’s audio volume to zero automatically, which for all practical purposes is the same as removing an audio file from a video. After you upload a video to the platform, you’ll be able to preview it without sound, and if you like the result you can click on the <strong>Create button</strong>. Generating a muted file can take a while, depending on how long is the video, but once the process is completed, you can click on the <strong>Download button</strong> to save the video to your computer or the <strong>Edit button</strong> if you want to go through all the steps of muting a video again. All tools on the Kapwing platform are free, but the <strong>videos you mute will be watermarked</strong> unless you pay a small fee to remove the watermark.</p><h4 id="5-Remove-Sound-From-Videos-Online-3"><a href="#5-Remove-Sound-From-Videos-Online-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Remove Sound From Videos Online"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="http://removesoundfromvideosonline.blogspot.com/" >Remove Sound From Videos Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/removesoundfromvideosonline.jpg"                      alt="online audio remover.jpg"                ></p><p>The wide range of supported audio and video formats make this platform a reliable option for anyone who wants to extract an audio file from a video or remove the original audio from the video completely. Click on the <strong>Choose File button</strong> and then select either <strong>Remove Sound or Extract Sound</strong> option. If you want to <strong>Extract Sound</strong> the platform lets you choose from <strong>MP3, iPhone ringtone or wav</strong> output audio file formats. Click on the <strong>Upload&amp;Convert</strong> button and wait for the video file to be processed. When the file is converted you can save the new video or audio file to a destination on your hard drive. However, the platform requests your <strong>mobile phone number</strong> before you can download a file and it <strong>displays ads</strong> after you click on the <strong>Download button</strong>, which can be quite frustrating if you want to remove audio from a video clip quickly.</p><h4 id="6-Using-YouTube-to-Remove-Audio-From-Videos-3"><a href="#6-Using-YouTube-to-Remove-Audio-From-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Using YouTube to Remove Audio From Videos"></a>6. Using <a class="link"   href="https://youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Remove Audio From Videos</h4><p>Although YouTube is not famous for its video or audio editing tools, you can still remove audio from videos in the platform’s <strong>Creator Studio</strong>. Select the video you’d like to mute and then go the <strong>Creator Studio’s Video tab</strong>. Once the options Video tab has to offer are displayed on the screen you should click on the <strong>Audio tab</strong>, that is located at the top of the screen next to <strong>Enhancements and End Screen and Annotations tabs</strong>. When the new tab opens you’ll notice that there is no option to remove audio from a video, but you can change the <strong>Featured Tracks</strong> option to <strong>Ambient</strong> and then select one of the available tracks in the menu below. The <strong>Favor Original Audio</strong> slider that is located below the preview window lets you control how much the new track is going to impact the video’s original sound. <strong>Drag the slider all the way to the right</strong> in order to avoid bringing back the original audio and then click on <strong>the Position Audio option</strong> to gain access to <strong>the audio waveform</strong>. <strong>Drag the slider located on the right side of the waveform all the way to the left to trim the duration of the new audio to approximately one second</strong> and the video will no longer have sound. <strong>This audio editing technique won’t work if you trim the new audio to zero</strong>, which is why it is important to <strong>carefully set the duration of the new audio track</strong> you added to the video. Click on the <strong>Save as New Video option</strong> to confirm the changes you’ve made and that’s it you successfully used YouTube to remove audio from a video.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Extracting or muting a video online is easy since you just have to upload a video file and the online tool you’ve chosen for this task will do the rest for you. The only downside is that you have to mute the entire video since none of the platforms featured in this article allows you to choose the section of a video you’d like to mute.

He or she works not only as a director, but also a cinematographer and the camera operator.</p><p>However, as the production grows and needs large-scale filming, more specific members are needed for different departments. Whether you want to set up a filming studio, or join a movie-making workshop, you’d better figure out the entire composition of the film crew and choose the best one according to your capabilities.</p><p>To simplify the scenario, we have divided the crew into these major departments, as shown below, with their work areas.</p><h2 id="What-Is-the-Role-of-a-Producer"><a href="#What-Is-the-Role-of-a-Producer" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Role of a Producer?"></a>What Is the Role of a Producer?</h2><p>The producer is the main handler of the filming.

Build relationships with the industries"></a>4. Build relationships with the industries</h3><p>If the filming is starting and you don’t know who to choose, you should build a relationship with the appropriate people in the industry.

It allows you to adjust the audio tempo to sync with the video. You can slow down or speed up the audio with the button and setting. Auto Audio Sync is the ability to sync video and audio together automatically. Moreover, it is an all-in-one video editor with powerful functionality and a fully stacked feature set. It makes professional video editing easy with an intuitive interface, drag-and-drop editing, and advanced video editing features.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Auto-Audio-Sync-Tool"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Auto-Audio-Sync-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Auto Audio Sync Tool"></a>Steps to Use Auto Audio Sync Tool</h3><p>This tool is best as it gives a perfect result when you try to match your audio files with your video files. For example, you might have a YouTube channel, and you record your audio from a Microphone, your video from a webcam camera, and your screen from your computer. The audio directly from the camera could be a little faint, resulting from the recording being farther from where you are. While the audio from the microphone would give you a high-quality audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-3.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>First, detach your audio file from your screen recording as the tool works with an audio file and a video file. Right-click on the audio file and click on detach audio to separate the audio file from the screen recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-4.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>Return the audio file and the screen recording to the normal position, which gives you three layers on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-5.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>Next, select your audio and your video by making sure both footages are related to each other and then right-click and then tap the audio synchronization. This will sync the audio and the video together, and the echo will seize because the footage will perfectly match the audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-6.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-–-Merging-Audio-and-Video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-–-Merging-Audio-and-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video"></a>Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video</h2><p>The first way that can help you sync audio and video is merging the two files. You can simply get the media from the folders and this allows you to sync a max of 16 audio files to single video.</p><ul><li>To proceed, press <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Command</strong>&gt; key on Windows and Mac respectively. Now, pick out the two files that you want to merge. You will now get the Merge Clips menu having a list of options. Choose Audio option and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro"                ></p><ul><li>Premiere Pro will now examine your video’s audio with the help of External audio and find out the similarities. In a couple of minutes, you will receive a new file with the name given to it in the Merge Clips menu.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-Manually-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-Manually-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro</h2><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Another is the manual way to sync audio to your videos. In order to work with this uncomplicated way of synchronization, get your video clip and the audio file into the timeline. Make sure to stack up the two files loosely (do not group them).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-file-sync-audio-manually.jpg"                      alt="import files"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, you may have either used a professional slate&#x2F;clapper or simply done a single clap with your hands to give a clue to start performing. All you need to do is to zoom the video file in the timeline. Look for the spike in waveforms that shows the slate. Where you notice the spike, slide the audio file and make the markers lined up.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-manually.jpg"                      alt="merge audio manually"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Start playing the clip to see if it works perfectly. Just in case, if a little tweaking is still required, click the audio file and hold down the Shift key while tapping left or right arrow key to adjust the audio file as per requirement.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/finish-sync-audio.jpg"                      alt="finish sync audio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-with-Plug-in"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-with-Plug-in" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Sync Audio to Video with Plug in"></a>Part 4: How to Sync Audio to Video with Plug in</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.redgiant.com/products/shooter-pluraleyes/" >PluralEyes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the next ideal option to work with. It is a plug-in and comes for $200 from Red Giant. When you have the projects like documentaries which include numerous camera angles, PluralEyes easily handles such stuff and make audio and video synchronization easy for you.</p><ul><li>For this, run PluralEyes and hit on <strong>Add Media</strong> to import the clip. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file directly to Premiere Pro. Now, click on <strong>Synchronize</strong> and let the program do the job.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sync-audio-PluralEyes.jpg"                      alt="PluralEyes sync audio"                ></p><ul><li>You will notice the synced clips in green while the files that are not synchronized will show up in red as errors. In case there are files with the red error, you need to get to the Sync drop-down menu and click <strong>Try Really Hard</strong>.</li><li>When the entire files are synced, hit on <strong>Export Timeline</strong> and you can then drag the exported project into Premiere Pro.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-How-to-Record-Audio-Properly"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-How-to-Record-Audio-Properly" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly"></a>Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly</h2><p>Nothing is worse than a bad quality audio file. You must have always wanted to keep a high-quality audio file, correct? More than desire, it is a vital thing to have. Hence, to record your audio appropriately, you must have a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >quality microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and an <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-digital-voice-recorders/" >audio recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that should stand out from others. This dual combination is significant in capturing the sound in an excellent quality and they indeed provide better output than an on-camera microphone.</p><p>The audio recorders with a little more price employ XLR cables. On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1&#x2F;8” jacks.</p><p>You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Watching a video out-of-sync is an extreme turn off.

For example, you might have a YouTube channel, and you record your audio from a Microphone, your video from a webcam camera, and your screen from your computer. The audio directly from the camera could be a little faint, resulting from the recording being farther from where you are. While the audio from the microphone would give you a high-quality audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-3.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>First, detach your audio file from your screen recording as the tool works with an audio file and a video file.
