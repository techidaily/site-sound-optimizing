Pexels is an online creative assets library that features high-resolution photos, including Pexels 4k, and an assortment of audio clips you can use in your creations.</p><p>The following are things you need to know about Pexels.com. It includes details on what Pexels is, important user information, and other hidden features of the website. Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part1-Is-Pexels-com-free-to-use"><a href="#Part1-Is-Pexels-com-free-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Is Pexels.com free to use?"></a>Part1: Is Pexels.com free to use?</h2><p>Yes, Pexels.com is a free online library of stock photos that you can use for personal or commercial purposes with your creations. In addition, photographers submit their images to the platform to allow others to reuse them.</p><p>Pexels’ free download policy allows you to obtain images under the Pexels or Creative common licensing rules. In addition, both licenses allow you to use Pexels images and videos for personal and commercial purposes, provided you make alterations to the original.</p><p>According to the site’s founders, the following are the reasons why the site is free:</p><ul><li>Its main source of revenue is selling advertisement slots to other paid-content databases.</li><li>You can also donate to the website’s operational costs with a single click. In addition, there is no limitation on how much and how often you can donate.</li><li>Most of the site’s contributors do so willingly to increase their brand exposure. For example, a verified user states that uploading his content to Pexels 4k and Pexels audio has resulted in an influx of high-paying customers.</li></ul><p>So, what is the difference between paid and stock photo sites? Paid content databases such as Shutterstock and Deposit photos require you to create a user ID and subscribe to their service. Conversely, stock photo sites like Pexels.com feature free stock images and videos that you can use with minimal restrictions.</p><p>For example, the site allows you to use its content on YouTube for personal or commercial reasons, provided you make adjustments to the original asset, and you own the video. In addition, the site’s library features content that its contributors share willingly. As such, you can download content from these sites without creating an account or acknowledging the image owner.</p><p>Currently, you can access Pexels through your web browser or download the app on your Android or iOS device. In addition, you can also access the asset library through the Canva application following their merger. Furthermore, you can also download it as a plugin for different content creation software, including Photoshop, MS Office, and Google Slides.</p><h2 id="Part2-What-can-Pexels-provide-you"><a href="#Part2-What-can-Pexels-provide-you" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What can Pexels provide you?"></a>Part2: What can Pexels provide you?</h2><p>Now that you are aware of Pexels.com’s origin story and access methods, here is a rundown of what free access provides you.</p><h3 id="1-4K-images-for-almost-all-topics"><a href="#1-4K-images-for-almost-all-topics" class="headerlink" title="1. 4K images for almost all topics"></a>1. 4K images for almost all topics</h3><p>Pexels.com features a dedicated library of over 40,000 4k images from their contributors. You can access the library by typing 4k in the site’s search engine. In addition, the library is full of 4k images across various topics, including niche subjects such as Nebula and Abstract. Furthermore, the site’s search engine uses search tags to provide more accurate results. For example, by typing 4K Dark in the search engine, the site can narrow down your search to provide more relevant results.</p><h3 id="2-Audio"><a href="#2-Audio" class="headerlink" title="2.

The ranking is based on the number of views of photos and videos you submit within thirty days. For example, you earn the top spot if you receive the most views to your content, provided it is less than thirty days old. As such, each contributor has an equal chance of rising to the top, provided they put in the effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-4k-3.jpg"                      alt="pexels"                ></p><p>On the other hand, Pexels challenges are monthly competitions where contributors submit their best work to win different prizes. Typically, each challenge varies in the category, prizes, and content specifications. For example, the most recent challenge required contributors to upload images projecting friendship.</p><p>In addition, there is no limitation to the number of eligible uploads because challenge officials consider all of them. Finally, all images you submit for the Pexels challenge fall under the Pexels license, meaning they are free to use by the site’s visitors.</p><h2 id="Part4-What-are-not-allowed-on-Pexels"><a href="#Part4-What-are-not-allowed-on-Pexels" class="headerlink" title="Part4: What are not allowed on Pexels?"></a>Part4: What are not allowed on Pexels?</h2><p>Currently, all of the Pexels creative assets are under the Pexels license, a variation to the creative commons zero license other stock photo sites offer. Although you can access and download the site’s assets for free, there are some restrictions on your usage of them. Here is what Pexels.com’s free download license does not allow you to do with its assets.</p><h3 id="1-It-can’t-be-used-in-a-political-context"><a href="#1-It-can’t-be-used-in-a-political-context" class="headerlink" title="1. It can’t be used in a political context"></a>1. It can’t be used in a political context</h3><p>You cannot use Pexels free download videos, images, and audio clips in a political context. This is because some of the assets include identifiable people, and using their image may be seen as their endorsement of your political beliefs. In addition, the situation becomes worse if your ideology contains offensive material and messaging.</p><p>Furthermore, the Pexels license also bans using their creative assets to promote your personal brand, especially when they contain any identifiable imagery. By doing so, Pexels.com remains a free resource for people of all creeds, regardless of their political affiliations.</p><h3 id="2-Resell-the-resources"><a href="#2-Resell-the-resources" class="headerlink" title="2. Resell the resources"></a>2. Resell the resources</h3><p>Another thing you cannot do when using Pexels.com is to resell their photos and videos to other stock photograph platforms. Most users attribute this to the site’s owners wanting to maintain a fresher database than its competitors.</p><p>In addition, you can also consider the restriction as a way to prevent duplication of results on web searches and prevent the overuse of creative assets. As such, you cannot use their creative assets on items such as print media and physical goods, including T-shirts and mugs.</p><h2 id="Part5-FAQs"><a href="#Part5-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part5: FAQs"></a>Part5: FAQs</h2><h3 id="Why-should-you-create-a-Pexels-account"><a href="#Why-should-you-create-a-Pexels-account" class="headerlink" title="Why should you create a Pexels account?"></a>Why should you create a Pexels account?</h3><p>Pexels.com seeks to create a simple and fast medium for you to discover free photos and videos.

If you recorded the audio from your Smartphone or a camera that doesn’t feature a professional microphone, chances are that the audio in that video clip will not be used in the project you are working on.</p><p>We will show you how you can remove audio files from a video in Magix Edit Pro in only a several simple steps that take a minimum amount of effort and time.</p><h2 id="Removing-Audio-from-Video-in-Magix-Movie-Edit-Pro-3"><a href="#Removing-Audio-from-Video-in-Magix-Movie-Edit-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Removing Audio from Video in Magix Movie Edit Pro"></a>Removing Audio from Video in Magix Movie Edit Pro</h2><p>During the editing process original audio files are often separated from the video files because video editors can manipulate video files better and the audio files are replaced by the sound recordings of better quality.</p><h4 id="1-Place-the-video-clips-onto-the-timeline-3"><a href="#1-Place-the-video-clips-onto-the-timeline-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can do so by clicking on the ‘Import’ tab and dragging the file to the timeline from the folder in which the video clip is stored. After you’ve positioned the video file onto the video track in the Magix Movie Edit Pro you will notice that the audio file isn’t displayed, which means that audio and video tracks are linked together and that all the changes you make on the video file will also apply to the audio file.</p><h4 id="2-Separate-the-audio-and-the-video-3"><a href="#2-Separate-the-audio-and-the-video-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Separate the audio and the video"></a>2.Separate the audio and the video</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-ungroup.JPG"                      alt="magix ungroup"                ></p><p>In order to avoid changing the speed of the audio file when you are trying to alter the playback speed of the video file, you need to separate the two files. You can do this easily, by selecting the video clip on the timeline and clicking the ‘Ungroup’ icon located on the editor’s toolbar. Upon clicking the ‘Ungroup’ icon you will be able to see the audio file on the track directly below the video track.</p><p>If you would like to remove an entire file, select it and then right-click on it. From the menu that emerges select the ‘Delete objects’ option or just hit the ‘Delete’ button on your keyboard. However, if you would like to use parts of the original file utilize the ‘Split objects’ tool to separate the parts of the audio file you want to use, from the ones you don’t need. Then after cutting all the parts of the file, you don’t want to use, delete them by using one of the two methods we described.</p><p>In order to reach a high level of precision, click on the ‘Zoom current object’ icon that is located in the lower right corner of the editor.

For example, if you want people to feel happy about something or if it’s about a celebration, then an instrumental one will work better than a vocal one because most people don’t like singing along with instrumental songs since they don’t know what the actual lyrics are.</p><h4 id="5-Think-about-the-emotions-you-want-to-convey"><a href="#5-Think-about-the-emotions-you-want-to-convey" class="headerlink" title="5.

But what if you record noise-free audio instead?</p><p>If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.</p><p>If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn’t there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.</p><p>Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.</p><p>Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.</p><p>One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists.

You will see four options: silence detection, modify audio, disconnect audio, and mute. Choose the “Audio” option from the drop-down menu if you want to separate the audio from the video.</p><p>Step3 Remove Background Static</p><p>Double-click on the audio track to eliminate the background noise directly, and pick “normal denoise” from the Edit Panel. You may also double-click the video clip in the timeline to reach the Editing panel without first separating the audio from the video.

For a better effect, adjust the audio frame by frame until it fits perfectly with the video. After the result, you can click “Export” to save the less noisy video on your PC or directly post it to YouTube or Vimeo.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-Noise-Free-Audio-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-Noise-Free-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Record Noise-Free Audio?"></a>Part 3: How to Record Noise-Free Audio?</h2><p>So, that was <strong>how to remove static sound from audio</strong>. But what if you record noise-free audio instead?</p><p>If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.</p><p>If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn’t there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.</p><p>Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.</p><p>Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.</p><p>One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists. If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem?

One of the most common problems we face is that our volumes are not normalized, and we need to take some extra time in order to achieve the best result for our audiences. Even with little or no knowledge about this very specific topic, we need to inform ourselves and find the solutions, make our videos more watch-able and our audios more listen-able, so to say.</p><p>There are several ways the audio normalization is achieved. One type is called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; the second is loudness normalization, adjusting the recording based on perceived loudness. RMS (Root-Mean-Square) changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p><p>Mostly, there are two reasons why we should give audio normalization a try. You need to decide yourself, what is your reason and expected outcome when you use audio normalization. First is when your aim is to get the maximum volume, but the second boils down to matching different volumes with each other.</p><p>When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.</p><p>More concretely, in general, audio normalization is when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, “the norm” for the project. It means that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.</p><p>You can have the desired result using different kinds of software. Nowadays, a lot of programs offer you the tool which facilitates this process. So, one of them would be DaVinci Resolve, which we are going to discuss in this article.</p><p>What is DaVinci Resolve? The description goes: “DaVinci Resolve is the world’s only solution that combines editing, color correction, visual effects, motion graphics and audio post production all in one software tool!” so, let’s discover what this software can do to help us balance the audio!</p><p>So, how to balance your audio in DaVinci Resolve? We are going to discuss everything step by step – how to set your target loudness level, how to monitor the loudness, and how you can use the automation feature.</p><p>Well, of course, have the program installed and opened. Then, add your video with the audio you want to edit or the audio separately, if that’s what you are aiming to do.</p><p>The first step you need to make is to set your target loudness level – for this, find the little settings button on the right bottom of the program and click on it. Now, go down to the Fairlight menu and change the Target Loudness Level. If you are doing the audio normalization for the Youtube content, then it is recommended to set it to -14 LUFS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-1.jpg"                      alt="set target loudness"                ></p><p>Next, you are going to head to the Fairlight page and make sure that your meters are open. the loudness meter is on the right top of the layout of the program, and it goes from +9 to -15 LUFS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-2.jpg"                      alt="make sure open the meters"                ></p><p>Here, zero represents exactly what our target loudness level is, in this case, as you remember, we set it to -14 LUFS. So, ensure that our loudness is as close as zero as possible on the meter, but you can also make it lower, such as -3. Whenever you play, you will be able to see that there are some numbers popping up to the right of the meter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-audio-davinci-3.jpg"                      alt="set loudness as close as zero"                ></p><p>The first one, you’ll find, is Short – constantly changing, indicating how far above or below the target loudness level you are at a given time. Short Max tells you how far above or below your target loudness level the loudest point of your video is.

Finding specific edit locations when editing footage or keyframing effects is made simpler by these characteristics. Audio waveforms in Final Cut Pro alter based on the volume of a clip or any applied effects. When the volume is high, the waveform is larger; when the volume is low, it is smaller. But when using FCP to edit video, people frequently experience issues with <strong>audio waveform disappearing</strong>. Or you do want to <strong>add some dynamic effects for audio waves</strong>?

We will give you all the information you need to know before going for a montage music download. We will also highlight where you can get music tracks to add to your montage video.</p><h2 id="Things-to-Be-Aware-of-Before-Downloading-Montage-Music"><a href="#Things-to-Be-Aware-of-Before-Downloading-Montage-Music" class="headerlink" title="Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music"></a>Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music</h2><p>Before you download montage music, you must factor in the following crucial things:</p><h4 id="1-The-Storage-Space-Available-on-Your-Target-Device"><a href="#1-The-Storage-Space-Available-on-Your-Target-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device"></a>1. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device</h4><p>Unlike documents, montage music takes loads of space. If you plan to download many tracks, you might run out of disk space if your device has limited storage space. For this reason, before you start looking for downloadable montage music, check if you have ample space on your target drive.</p><p>If your disk space is almost depleted, you can delete some files that you rarely use or back them up in another drive. You can also uninstall apps or programs that you rarely use but are readily available online. If you are using your mobile device to download montage music, you can expand the memory.</p><h4 id="2-The-Safety-of-Your-Device"><a href="#2-The-Safety-of-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="2. The Safety of Your Device"></a>2. The Safety of Your Device</h4><p>When looking for free downloadable montage music, you have to factor in the safety of your device. Attacks by cybercriminals are now targeting individuals. Be extra vigilant with the platforms you choose. The site you pick should have a good reputation in dealing with threats.</p><p>Before you download montage music, you need to consider the site you are getting them from: Not all sites are equal in quality and legality; some may be more reliable.</p><p>Do your research before downloading montage music from any site. Ensure the website is legit to avoid downloading files with malware or viruses.</p><h4 id="3-Internet-Connectivity"><a href="#3-Internet-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Internet Connectivity"></a>3. Internet Connectivity</h4><p>You’ll need a strong internet connection to montage music download. Most people use mobile phone contracts with specific data caps that do not allow venturing outside email or the usual social media connection.</p><p>If you download montage music using a phone contract, there’s a risk that you might exhaust the allocated data and incur additional charges. You should, therefore, understand when and where to download montage music.</p><p>If you’ve got free Wi-Fi at work, you might want to schedule all the montage music downloads and run them while doing your job. You can also download montage music using free Wi-Fi hubs around establishments like government facilities and hospitals. But, be extra careful with open Wi-Fi, as cybercriminals use this channel to hit targets.</p><h4 id="4-The-Copyright-Status-Of-The-Montage-Music"><a href="#4-The-Copyright-Status-Of-The-Montage-Music" class="headerlink" title="4. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music"></a>4. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music</h4><p>When downloading montage music, it’s crucial to be aware of its copyright status. Some montage music tracks have copyright law protection, meaning downloading them will be violating the law.</p><p>Before you download any montage music online, read the download site’s terms and conditions. In turn, this will help you to understand what is allowed and what is not.</p><h4 id="5-The-Quality-of-the-Montage-Music-File"><a href="#5-The-Quality-of-the-Montage-Music-File" class="headerlink" title="5.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The CB3-532 Chromebook 15 from Acer is by no means a flashy laptop, but that’s likely a positive attribute if you’re in the market for a solid Chromebook. With a price that comes in well under $200, and the processor isn’t going to provide any record-breaking speeds. What you do get is a perfectly functional machine for basic productivity, full web-browsing, media consumption, and even some light gaming.</p><p> You’re also getting a massive display that actually impressed us in our tests, especially when compared to other laptops in this range. I spent a few days of regular use with this Chromebook and broke down what it does well and what corners it has to cut to meet this price point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KPrvN1kvoH081BHRUonphp9CIeY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer_LaptopsUnder200_Chromebook_02-c3813ec58fc848e6a715abe090ebe6b1.jpg"                      alt="Acer Chromebook 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jason Schneider</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857869/11832" target="_top" id="857869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857869/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Slightly-bulky-with-a-couple-of-nice-touches"><a href="#Design-Slightly-bulky-with-a-couple-of-nice-touches" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slightly bulky with a couple of nice touches"></a><strong>Design: Slightly bulky with a couple of nice touches</strong></h2><p> The first thing you’ll notice about this laptop is just how large it is. That’s mostly to be expected, because it does sport a 15.6-inch display, meaning the chassis has to be at least that big. But the large, approximately 1-inch bezels around the screen make it pretty large, even considering the expected footprint.</p><p> The color scheme feels very modern, looking very similar to Apple’s space gray. There’s a soft brushed-aluminum-style texture on the top, and a dark, roughened plastic base and inner bezels. There are also two large, round-rectangle speaker grilles flanking the speakers that give it a more assertive look than the usual, simple aesthetic used by other laptops.</p><p> The hinge is actually two small contact points that roll into the laptop chassis, which feels dated when the laptop is open but makes it look interesting when it’s closed. The whole laptop is made of plastic, and measures right around one 1-inch thick, weighing in at almost 4.5 pounds. That’s a double-edged sword because while the laptop feels really sturdy and premium despite the plastic material, it isn’t terribly portable.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-As-seamless-as-a-mobile-device"><a href="#Setup-Process-As-seamless-as-a-mobile-device" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: As seamless as a mobile device"></a><strong>Setup Process: As seamless as a mobile device</strong></h2><p> One added benefit to opting for a Chromebook instead of a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >full PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that the software is really light. This has implications for both productivity and performance, but it provides a big benefit for the setup process. Because the entire experience, from bootup to browsing, has been designed by Google, you can expect a very similar look and feel to what you’ve probably experienced when signing up and signing in to a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-gmail-1172005" >Gmail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or YouTube account.</p><p> The device first asks you to set your regions, then connect to a Wi-Fi network, then finally to sign into a Google account and set up permissions. From here it drops you basically immediately to the Chromebook home screen where you can either dive right in, or follow the popup tour given by Google. One thing I liked a lot about this was that Google gives you a short three-popup tour to start, then asks if you’d like to go deeper or just jump right into the machine yourself. This staged version of a device tour is a great way to let you, the user, tailor it to your preferences. This also makes it great for an older-aged tech user who might need a bit of hand-holding as they get to know their laptop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Big-bright-and-better-than-you-might-think"><a href="#Display-Big-bright-and-better-than-you-might-think" class="headerlink" title="Display: Big, bright, and better than you might think"></a><strong>Display: Big, bright, and better than you might think</strong></h2><p> The display on the Acer Chromebook 15 is bigger than you might expect from a laptop that runs<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-chrome-os-1616448" >Chrome OS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with a 15.6-inch backlit LED screen that offers a ton of room for windows and programs. The resolution measures in at 1366x768 meaning it checks all the boxes for being classified as an HD display.</p><p> What surprised me was just how good this screen looks for a budget panel. Most screens at this level will give you just enough pixels to advertise themselves as HD, but will skimp on viewing angles and color representation. But, the screen offers plenty of brightness, and if you turn the blue temperature down a bit (do this in the “night light” part of the Settings section, but turn it on all the time, not just during bedtime), the screen looks really decent.</p><p> The whole laptop is made of plastic, and measures right around 1-inch thick, weighing in at almost 4.5 pounds.</p><h2 id="Performance-Really-solid-to-a-point"><a href="#Performance-Really-solid-to-a-point" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Really solid, to a point"></a><strong>Performance: Really solid, to a point</strong></h2><p> Chrome OS provides an interesting advantage in the performance category. Right out of the box, this laptop will look and feel very fast, but as soon as you try to open more than about 6 tabs on Chrome, or you fire up multiple apps and videos, it slows down exponentially. On paper, it sports a dual-core Intel Celeron N3060 processor capable for standard-run speeds of 1.6GHz.</p><p> The configuration I chose also includes 4GB of LPDDR3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159" >RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and 16GB of eMMC memory. These last two points help to make up for the somewhat limited processor by giving decent short-term storage needs and a reasonably fast flash-style memory. But, because the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ddr3-vs-ddr4-which-ram-is-best-4779993" >DDR3 RAM is a bit dated <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and caps out at 4GB, you’ll find that it gets a little sluggish when you push it. It’s also unfortunate to see merely 16GB of storage, severely limiting the amount of movies, photos, and files you can fit on the device.</p><p> To be fair, Chromebook users likely keep more files in cloud storage drives, and Google includes 100GB of drive storage for free with the purchase for 2 years. So, you might not notice the limited capacity, but I would have preferred at least 32GB.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885932/19272" target="_top" id="1885932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-and-Component-Quality-Plenty-of-screen-real-estate-and-passable-features"><a href="#Productivity-and-Component-Quality-Plenty-of-screen-real-estate-and-passable-features" class="headerlink" title="Productivity and Component Quality: Plenty of screen real estate, and passable features"></a><strong>Productivity and Component Quality: Plenty of screen real estate, and passable features</strong></h2><p> There’s an interesting case to be made for this Acer Chromebook in terms of productivity. Chrome OS is a very light operating system, which means that it runs quick and light, at least initially. This also means that you can load up more than a few Chrome tabs—something that hogs a lot of power use on Windows laptops. Add that in with the larger 15.6-inch display, giving you lots of room for multiple windows and apps, and this Chromebook is great for those who want to multitask. However, because it isn’t a full OS, you won’t be able to run a whole lot of programs out of the box, and you’re limited to what’s available in the Play Store.</p><p> The fit and finish of this laptop also contributes to its productivity capabilities. The full-sized keyboard is actually pretty passable, which is surprising for such a budget device. Because the chassis is thicker, Acer has been able to put in a bit more key travel than you might expect, and even though the action of the keyboard feels just a bit mushy, I found the keyboard pretty great to use.</p><p> I am a little annoyed with the “search” key that Chromebooks placed where a caps lock key should be–resulting in a lot of accidental search callups. The trackpad also leaves a bit to be desired, requiring a firm, chunky press, and doesn’t support as many gestures as Windows or OSX.</p><h2 id="Audio-An-unexpected-letdown"><a href="#Audio-An-unexpected-letdown" class="headerlink" title="Audio: An unexpected letdown"></a><strong>Audio: An unexpected letdown</strong></h2><p> Laptops are never amazing specimen when it comes to on-board speakers, so I wasn’t expecting much out of this either. Because it’s a 15-inch machine, there’s plenty of room in the Chromebook 15 for more components, and Acer has opted to put in two giant speaker grilles along either side of the keyboard. Taking that into account, I was hoping that the speakers would be louder and fuller than a normal laptop. However, the response is very tinny and it wasn’t as loud as I was hoping. In fact, these are among the worst speakers I’ve tested on a budget laptop, leaving me to believe that the grilles are just for show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/yw3n6Y9SGTIh4h10bF7XbAc5La0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer_LaptopsUnder200_Chromebook_03-5724a73204e94f548f20aec5fa86074f.jpg"                      alt="Acer Chromebook 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jason Schneider</p><h2 id="Network-and-connectivity-Modern-fast-and-optimized-for-Chrome-OS"><a href="#Network-and-connectivity-Modern-fast-and-optimized-for-Chrome-OS" class="headerlink" title="Network and connectivity: Modern, fast, and optimized for Chrome OS"></a><strong>Network and connectivity: Modern, fast, and optimized for Chrome OS</strong></h2><p> Despite the lighter OS, the Chromebook 15 offers modern, well-equipped network features. First off, there’s an 802.11ac-capable Wi-Fi card built-in, which means you’ll get less interference than the N-protocol Wi-Fi, and you’ll have access to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-5-ghz-wifi-better-than-2-4-ghz-818293" >5GHz bands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> common in most modern routers. There’s also Bluetooth 4.2 capability which provided me with a plenty-stable connection for my Bluetooth headphones, and will work nicely if you want to connect a mouse or other peripherals.</p><p> As far as ports go, there are the requisite AC power and 3.5mm headphone input ports, plus a full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI output <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for connecting an external monitor. There are also two USB 3.0 ports—one on each side—for increased data transfer speeds. I would have liked to see at least one<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB Type-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as the mobile industry is heading decidedly in that direction, but it isn’t the end of the world. There’s also a full-sized SD card slot to help expand the storage of the device, which is important considering how little space is available on the device itself. Overall, this thing checks most of the boxes, though with the large chassis it would have been nice to have seen just a few more I&#x2F;O options.</p><h2 id="Camera-Grainy-but-passable"><a href="#Camera-Grainy-but-passable" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Grainy, but passable"></a><strong>Camera: Grainy, but passable</strong></h2><p> Most laptops I’ve tested at any price point sport a borderline abysmal webcam, so my expectations are never high for low-end laptops like this one. However, even though the pictures and videos recorded are noticeable grainy, the color response was pretty good.</p><p> This is likely because Google is calling this an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -capable webcam, meaning the software is increasing the ISO to give you clear performance. This gives you good color response as I’ve noted, but it does also result in that graininess. This shouldn’t be a breaking point in either direction for considering a laptop like this, but if you do a lot of video calls, it’s an important thing to consider.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-life-Very-reliable-with-smart-optimization"><a href="#Battery-life-Very-reliable-with-smart-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Battery life: Very reliable with smart optimization"></a><strong>Battery life: Very reliable with smart optimization</strong></h2><p> As a light OS, it wasn’t that surprising to see excellent battery life on the Chromebook 15, but I was pleased with just how long the battery lasted. There’s a 3,920mAh lithium-polymer battery that Acer pins at about 12 hours of use. That holds true, perhaps trending toward a little less.</p><p> That’s an impressive performance for a display this large, as there are a lot of pixels to push, but is likely a result of Chrome OS’s light running load and display brightness optimization. The battery also recharges very quickly, allowing for you to quickly add some extra juice to a dying laptop in a pinch. All in all, this is definitely a pro for this device, making it a reliable travel machine.</p><p> Chrome OS is a very light operating system, which means that it runs quick and light, at least initially.</p><h2 id="Software-Light-and-fast-with-very-little-customization"><a href="#Software-Light-and-fast-with-very-little-customization" class="headerlink" title="Software: Light and fast with very little customization"></a><strong>Software: Light and fast with very little customization</strong></h2><p> Using Chrome OS is more reliable than you might think. You have most of the functions you’ll need from Google Docs to web browsing to file storage. However, you’ll be missing a lot of more specialized programs, like the full Adobe Creative Suite, or PC-based media programs. Due to the low-powered processor and limited shared Graphics capability, you wouldn’t be able to use this laptop for video editing anyway, even if it did run Windows. So, even though it’s limiting, it’s on purpose.</p><p> That said, the Chromebook 15 runs so well, though likely only because of the lightweight operating system and limited app capabilities. Chrome OS is kind of like just using a Chrome window with a bunch of tabs on a regular PC. For most people, the OS is more than capable of handling most of your browsing needs. This Chromebook is a great example of how far you can push Chrome OS on a budget device, with a big bright screen for watching movies, too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027176/19272" target="_top" id="2027176">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027176" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027176/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Really-affordable-with-plenty-to-offer"><a href="#Price-Really-affordable-with-plenty-to-offer" class="headerlink" title="Price: Really affordable with plenty to offer"></a><strong>Price: Really affordable with plenty to offer</strong></h2><p> The list price for this Acer Chromebook sits at just about $400 (MSRP), but most of the time you can find it on Amazon for between $150-$250. I picked up my unit for about $185, and it tends to hover just around there.</p><p> For the money, I can confidently say this laptop is worth the price, as long as you have the right applications in mind for it. If you want a cheap starter laptop, or a machine for an older family member that’s easy to use, but you don’t want to spend half a grand getting there, this is a great choice. I can’t say it’s quite as travel-friendly as some of the other budget laptops out there, due to the size and weight. But if you want an affordable machine that’s great for light productivity tasks, and is an excellent movie machine, then you should consider this.</p><h2 id="Acer-Chromebook-15-vs-Lenovo-Chromebook-S330-14"><a href="#Acer-Chromebook-15-vs-Lenovo-Chromebook-S330-14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Chromebook 15 vs. Lenovo Chromebook S330 14"></a><strong>Acer Chromebook 15 vs. Lenovo Chromebook S330 14</strong></h2><p> Lenovo’s entry into the large, budget Chromebook range brings a few different features into play. The most notable difference is the build—you’ll get a thinner, sleeker laptop with the Lenovo, including a much more premium-looking and -feeling keyboard, plus 64GB of storage and a lighter weight. However, you’ll sacrifice the Intel processor (the Lenovo sports a more dated chip from MediaTek) and the battery life isn’t quite as good. That package comes in at a little higher on the price scale, too.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A solid Chromebook for productivity, but limited in portability.</strong></p><p> This is a great Chromebook with a lot of impressive things to offer. The bright screen has plenty of room for vibrant video viewing and multiple windows of productivity. The excellent battery life means you won’t be tethered to a desk, and the light, fast Chrome OS means it will take a lot to slow the Acer Chromebook 15 down.

Very few people think of audio editing when they talk about AE, even though this application offers a simple way to add Fade in and fade out effects to audio files used in soundtracks.</p><p>However, you will need to have at least basic video and sound editing skills to fade in and fade out audio files in AE since the app doesn’t offer a preset that you can drag and drop to the timeline. So, in this article, we will show how to create the Fade in and fade out effects in Adobe After Effects in just a few simple steps.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Audio Mixer Software to Trim Your Sound Easily &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE"><a href="#Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE"></a>Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects"></a>Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects</h3><p>Once you’ve created a new project in AE and you’ve imported the audio files you’d like to include in the soundtrack of the video you’re making, you should place that audio file on the timeline. Click on the arrow located next to the audio file, then click on the Audio arrow that will be displayed under the file, and finally click on the Waveform arrow. This will enable you to see the waveform of the audio file you’d like to edit on the timeline and allow you to add Fade in and fade out effects with more precision. The file you added to your composition will be displayed as a layer in the Composition tab located in the lower-left region of the software’s interface.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fade-out-in-audio-after-effects-waveform.jpg" alt="fade out/in audio waveform after effects"></p><h3 id="Step-2-Add-a-keyframe-to-the-audio-file"><a href="#Step-2-Add-a-keyframe-to-the-audio-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file"></a>Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file</h3><p>The next thing you will have to do is place the playhead at the exact location where you want the Fade In effect to start. In most cases, Fade effects are added at the starting point of the audio file, so you should position the playhead at the beginning of the timeline or zero seconds. You will be able to see a stopwatch next to the Audio Levels option located in the Composition tab. Click on it to add the first keyframe and assign a negative value to the Audio Level setting. -100db or -50db values will make the audio file silent, and you can pick either based on how long you want the Fade in effect to last.

Set the Audio Level value to 0db, and that is it. You’ve created the Fade in effect. Keep in mind that you can use more than two keyframes to fade in audio, enabling you to increase the audio level gradually.

You will be able to see a stopwatch next to the Audio Levels option located in the Composition tab. Click on it to add the first keyframe and assign a negative value to the Audio Level setting. -100db or -50db values will make the audio file silent, and you can pick either based on how long you want the Fade in effect to last.

Set the Audio Level value to 0db, and that is it. You’ve created the Fade in effect. Keep in mind that you can use more than two keyframes to fade in audio, enabling you to increase the audio level gradually. The process of creating the Fade effect requires you to add a keyframe that has a 0db value a few seconds before the clip ends and then add another keyframe at the very end of the audio file that has -50 or -100db audio level value.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/complete-fade-iin-out-audio-after-effects.jpg" alt="Complete fade out/in audio in After Effects"></p><h2 id="Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-3"><a href="#Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects"></a>Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects</h2><p>The process of creating a fade in or a fade out effect in AE is quite simple, but it is up to you to discover creative ways of using these effects. Here are a few tips that can help you use these audio effects more creatively.</p><h3 id="1-Avoid-Hard-Cuts-3"><a href="#1-Avoid-Hard-Cuts-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Avoid Hard Cuts"></a>1. Avoid Hard Cuts</h3><p>A high pitch sound at the very begging of a new sequence can ruin your soundtrack and ultimately the entire video, so in case you’ve cut an audio file at the location where the sound peaks, you can apply a fade in effect to make the transition between two audio files softer.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Cut Video in After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression-3"><a href="#2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Be Mindful of Audio Compression</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://theproaudiofiles.com/compression-techniques/" >Audio compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a process that reduces loud sounds and amplifies quiet sounds, resulting from the audio file’s dynamic range being compressed. In most cases, you won’t notice the effects of audio compression, but if you compress an audio file too much, you might get some unwanted side effects if you add a fade out effect to that file. That’s why it is best to rely on the default audio compression features a video or audio editing app offers.</p><h3 id="3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively-3"><a href="#3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively"></a>3. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively</h3><p>Besides opening and closing scenes, you can also use the Fade in and fade out effects to mix two different tracks while the shot is still in progress. Fade out one track, make it look like a scene is ending, and then introduce a new theme that changes the mood of that scene. The important thing is to avoid reducing the audio level all the way to -100db because you might end up creating silence in a scene that disrupts the flow of an entire video.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Fading in or fading out audio files in Adobe After Effects doesn’t require much effort, as you have to add a few keyframes to the file and adjust the Audio Level value. However, finding the best way to improve the quality of your soundtrack by applying these effects may take some practice. Do you often add Fade in and fade out audio effects in AE?

To keep the audio works properly on your computer, it’s essential that you have the latest correct audio driver at all times.</p><p>There are two ways you can update your audio driver:</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Option 1 – Manually <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.</p><p>OR</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/hearthstone-no-sound-issue/#e2" >Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  – This is the quickest and easiest option.

To get it, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.</p><p> Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.</p><h4 id="Option-2-–-Automatically-update-your-audio-driver"><a href="#Option-2-–-Automatically-update-your-audio-driver" class="headerlink" title="Option 2 – Automatically update your audio driver"></a>Option 2 – Automatically update your audio driver</h4><p> If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.</p><p> You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy.
