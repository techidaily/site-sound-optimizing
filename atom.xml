The process of normalizing audio with iMovie is rather simple as you just have to import an audio or video file that contains sound into the <strong>Project Browser</strong> <strong>and double-click on it.</strong> Once <strong>the Inspector pops up on the screen</strong> you should select the <strong>Audio option</strong> and click on the <strong>Normalize Clip Volume setting</strong>. iMovie will then normalize the audio in the selected file, so you should just wait for the process to be over and click <strong>Done</strong> afterward.</p><h4 id="2-Movavi"><a href="#2-Movavi" class="headerlink" title="2.

This video editing software for Mac and PC computers is best suited for video content creators who don’t have a lot of experience, although skilled video editing professionals can also use it to edit their footage. The audio normalization process in Movavi can be completed in just a few easy steps. After creating the project in the <strong>Full Feature Mode</strong>, you should click on the <strong>Add Media Files icon</strong> and import the files you’d like to use in that project. Place the files to the appropriate track on the timeline and then <strong>double-click on the file that is located on the audio track.</strong> Once the <strong>Tools panel</strong> appears on the screen, you just have to <strong>make sure that the Normalize tickbox is checked</strong> and Movavi will normalize the audio automatically.</p><h4 id="3-Audacity"><a href="#3-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can use this app to create sound effects, merge multiple audio files together, or record narration for each new video you create. <strong>Normalizing audio with Audacity</strong> is easy because you just have to <strong>add the audio clips to the timeline</strong> and <strong>make sure that the track to which you added a file is selected.</strong> The app also lets you select more than just one track, so you can place audio files to two or more tracks and files from each track are going to be adjusted to the same audio level. Once you’ve selected a track or tracks that contain audio clips you’d like to normalize, head over to the <strong>Effects menu, choose the Normalize option, and hit OK</strong>.</p><h2 id="Tips-on-Audio-Normalization"><a href="#Tips-on-Audio-Normalization" class="headerlink" title="Tips on Audio Normalization"></a>Tips on Audio Normalization</h2><p>A single scene can contain a lot of different sounds. The sound of someone’s footsteps, ambient sounds, or the dialogue are just a few examples of sounds that are frequently used in videos and movies. The audio volume of each of these sounds shouldn’t be the same, because if the ambient sounds are as loud as the dialogue the audience may find it hard to understand what the characters in that scene are saying. That’s why you should use audio normalization only when you are absolutely sure that using the same audio volume level for two or more audio clips won’t disrupt the flow of your video.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Even though normalizing audio with each of the video editing software products we featured in this article is a straightforward process, this option should only be used if you have no other way to balance the audio volume of a video or an audio file.

The sound of someone’s footsteps, ambient sounds, or the dialogue are just a few examples of sounds that are frequently used in videos and movies. The audio volume of each of these sounds shouldn’t be the same, because if the ambient sounds are as loud as the dialogue the audience may find it hard to understand what the characters in that scene are saying. That’s why you should use audio normalization only when you are absolutely sure that using the same audio volume level for two or more audio clips won’t disrupt the flow of your video.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Even though normalizing audio with each of the video editing software products we featured in this article is a straightforward process, this option should only be used if you have no other way to balance the audio volume of a video or an audio file.

After adding music to your project, the audio is trimmed to the desired length using iMovie’s inbuilt tool.</p><p><strong>Step #1:</strong> Open iMovie on your iPhone or iPad.</p><p><strong>Step #2:</strong> Tap the movie project you want to edit.</p><p>It will display a list of your projects, among which you must select the one you want to edit.</p><p>If you want to edit a current section of video not even opened in iMovie, you have to make a new iMovie project to add your audio and video. Select the <strong>+</strong> icon, choose the <strong>Movie</strong> tab, select the video(s), and then choose the <strong>Create movie</strong> button.</p><p><strong>Step #3:</strong> Hit the <strong>Edit</strong> button below the name of your project.</p><p>This opens your project in the editor. And, you’re already in the editor if you just created a new project in the previous step.</p><p><strong>Step #4:</strong> Add audio to your project.</p><p>You can skip this step if your project already contains the audio.

To efficiently and adequately edit audio, you need a good set of speakers and headphones to hear the sound, and you also need to be able to see the sound.</p><p>If the waveforms don’t appear, go to the “view” drop-down menu and select “show waveforms”, the waveform would show you the sound intensity level of a sound clip and definitely would give you an idea of what part will need to be turned up or down.</p><ul><li><strong>Audio Adjustments</strong></li></ul><p>With the audio button situated at the top right, you have access to some essential audio editing tools for changing the sound level of your chosen clip or changing the relative volume of other films in the project.</p><p>The audio editing window also contains primary noise reduction and audio equalization tools and a range of effects – from robot to echo- which would affect how people sound in your video.</p><ul><li><strong>Editing Audio with the Timeline</strong></li></ul><p>iMovie permits you to adjust the audio within the clips themselves, each volume as a bar. You can shift up and down to increase or decrease the audio level. The clips also have “fade in” and “fade out” buttons at the beginning and end, which are draggable to adjust the fade length.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink"

In the following tutorial, I’m going to show you how to make the audio waveforms visible.</p><h3 id="1-Click-the-wrench-icon-on-settings-button"><a href="#1-Click-the-wrench-icon-on-settings-button" class="headerlink" title="1.

Make sure the last values for each selections are the same to maintain an even level. Next, you can change the characteristics to give your waveform the desired appearance. Here, I applied some fundamental settings that are effective for singing. Using the two-color picker options and the display options, you may also change the waveform’s inner and outer colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-8.jpg"                      alt="adjust the audio waveform effect"                ></p><h5 id="Step5Check-the-animation-and-export-the-video"><a href="#Step5Check-the-animation-and-export-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Step5Check the animation and export the video"></a>Step5Check the animation and export the video</h5><p>Back in Premiere, you can pick whether you want the traditional analog lines to appear or a more contemporary digital waveform.

I will recommend cleaning them manually by going to the location specified in <strong>“Preferences &gt; Media Cache”</strong>.</p><p>Clean the contents of the folder named Media Cache, Media Cache files, and Peak files (Before cleaning them, please ensure to open these folders once and verify if they have any of the media files in them to avoid any accidental deletion of required media or asset).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-10.jpg"                      alt="media cache files"                ></p><p>Please make sure that the option <strong>“Save.cfa and.pek cache files next to the original media files when possible”</strong> is unchecked.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-10-Websites-to-Download-Montage-Music"><a href="#Best-10-Websites-to-Download-Montage-Music" class="headerlink" title="Best 10 Websites to Download Montage Music"></a>Best 10 Websites to Download Montage Music</h2><p>In music, montage is a technique whereby newly branded compositions or sound objects, such as songs, are created from montage or collage. We will give you all the information you need to know before going for a montage music download. We will also highlight where you can get music tracks to add to your montage video.</p><h2 id="Things-to-Be-Aware-of-Before-Downloading-Montage-Music"><a href="#Things-to-Be-Aware-of-Before-Downloading-Montage-Music" class="headerlink" title="Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music"></a>Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music</h2><p>Before you download montage music, you must factor in the following crucial things:</p><h4 id="1-The-Storage-Space-Available-on-Your-Target-Device"><a href="#1-The-Storage-Space-Available-on-Your-Target-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device"></a>1. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device</h4><p>Unlike documents, montage music takes loads of space. If you plan to download many tracks, you might run out of disk space if your device has limited storage space. For this reason, before you start looking for downloadable montage music, check if you have ample space on your target drive.</p><p>If your disk space is almost depleted, you can delete some files that you rarely use or back them up in another drive. You can also uninstall apps or programs that you rarely use but are readily available online. If you are using your mobile device to download montage music, you can expand the memory.</p><h4 id="2-The-Safety-of-Your-Device"><a href="#2-The-Safety-of-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="2. The Safety of Your Device"></a>2. The Safety of Your Device</h4><p>When looking for free downloadable montage music, you have to factor in the safety of your device. Attacks by cybercriminals are now targeting individuals. Be extra vigilant with the platforms you choose. The site you pick should have a good reputation in dealing with threats.</p><p>Before you download montage music, you need to consider the site you are getting them from: Not all sites are equal in quality and legality; some may be more reliable.</p><p>Do your research before downloading montage music from any site. Ensure the website is legit to avoid downloading files with malware or viruses.</p><h4 id="3-Internet-Connectivity"><a href="#3-Internet-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Internet Connectivity"></a>3. Internet Connectivity</h4><p>You’ll need a strong internet connection to montage music download. Most people use mobile phone contracts with specific data caps that do not allow venturing outside email or the usual social media connection.</p><p>If you download montage music using a phone contract, there’s a risk that you might exhaust the allocated data and incur additional charges. You should, therefore, understand when and where to download montage music.</p><p>If you’ve got free Wi-Fi at work, you might want to schedule all the montage music downloads and run them while doing your job. You can also download montage music using free Wi-Fi hubs around establishments like government facilities and hospitals. But, be extra careful with open Wi-Fi, as cybercriminals use this channel to hit targets.</p><h4 id="4-The-Copyright-Status-Of-The-Montage-Music"><a href="#4-The-Copyright-Status-Of-The-Montage-Music" class="headerlink" title="4. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music"></a>4. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music</h4><p>When downloading montage music, it’s crucial to be aware of its copyright status. Some montage music tracks have copyright law protection, meaning downloading them will be violating the law.</p><p>Before you download any montage music online, read the download site’s terms and conditions. In turn, this will help you to understand what is allowed and what is not.</p><h4 id="5-The-Quality-of-the-Montage-Music-File"><a href="#5-The-Quality-of-the-Montage-Music-File" class="headerlink" title="5. The Quality of the Montage Music File"></a>5. The Quality of the Montage Music File</h4><p>Some montage music files you’ll find online are of low quality. And this can affect your audience’s listening experience. Before you get any downloadable montage music, check its quality.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Websites-to-Download-Montage-Music"><a href="#Top-10-Websites-to-Download-Montage-Music" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Websites to Download Montage Music"></a>Top 10 Websites to Download Montage Music</h2><p>There are lots of sites where you can download montage music tracks.

The bulk of smartphones these days have poor speakers and poor sound quality via the headphone jack. That’s when the <strong>sound</strong> <strong>booster</strong> for both Android and iPhone does wonder.</p><p> A quick exploration of the Play Store provides a wide range of apps for Android and iOS devices that can enhance sound performance via the headphone jack and speakers. However, many apps fail to deliver on their promises and do little to boost the audio level of your devices. Furthermore, a few of these apps are complete with ads that often appear, drawing attention away from the customer experiences. With that in mind, we’ve come up with a list of <strong>sound booster apps</strong> for Android and iOS that work perfectly and optimize your respective device’s audio output.</p><h2 id="10-Sound-Booster-Apps-That-Work-Perfectly-for-Android-and-iOS"><a href="#10-Sound-Booster-Apps-That-Work-Perfectly-for-Android-and-iOS" class="headerlink" title="10 Sound Booster Apps That Work Perfectly for Android and iOS"></a>10 Sound Booster Apps That Work Perfectly for Android and iOS</h2><p>Here are some of the best <strong>sound booster</strong> apps that may help you increase the sound levels for Android and iOS; they are specially planned to make your experiences great.</p><h3 id="1-Super-Volume-Booster-Android"><a href="#1-Super-Volume-Booster-Android" class="headerlink" title="1.

It connects you to strangers for discussion and chats. It was launched in 2009, as a chatting platform. But after some time it introduced a video conferencing feature to let people see each other instead of just chatting via messages. Today, it is more than just a chatting platform, millions of users use it throughout the world and enabling them to connect with strangers and making them friends. In 2012, it removed the restriction of filtered chatting and made the chat unmonitored. Letting people talk and exchange messages, images, and videos of their own choice without being restricted. But it also imposed the restriction of 13 years of age to use this platform. To avoid inappropriate messages and videos, they started using an image recognition algorithm. But it didn’t prevent sending and receiving adult content via video or text messages. The reason behind its popularity among teenagers is its ability to connect you with strangers without letting them see your personal information. The user can filter the strangers based on their age, gender, and location to get connected with their preferred individuals. In 2014, the developers brought a new advancement and feature into Omegle, allowing users with .edu emails provided by their institutions to pair with their peers anonymously without letting them know your real name and other personal information. In 2015, they introduce a new security update that restricted the use of bots. But it was later questioned by so many users because of still getting connected with bots. Omegle is also available for Android and iOS devices. The app for your mobile can be downloaded from their official website. The app is not available in Google Play and App Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/omegle-poster.png"                      alt="omegle-poster"                ></p><hr><h2 id="Is-Omegle-Safe-3"><a href="#Is-Omegle-Safe-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Omegle Safe?"></a>Is Omegle Safe?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/is-omegle-safe-poster.png"                      alt="is-omegle-safe-poster"                ></p><p>Being a communication platform that used your personal information and connects with people whom you don’t know, it seems to be a safe choice for making friends.

Let’s share with you some of the factors that make Omegle an insecure platform to be used.</p><p>Exposure to Profanity &amp; Pornographic Content</p><p>The algorithm of Omegle is an effective algorithm in recognizing sexual content, nudity, and profanity. It is unable to detect such elements in chats and video calls. This platform doesn’t have any restricted gateway that makes it easy for minors to enter the platform pretending to be adults. It allows them to access the content that is designed and restricted for adults only. This makes this platform a very insecure platform for them.</p><hr><h2 id="Privacy-of-the-Website-3"><a href="#Privacy-of-the-Website-3" class="headerlink" title="Privacy of the Website"></a>Privacy of the Website</h2><p>If you are very sensitive in the matter of privacy and protection of personal information, this site is not a worthy site for your use.

Even if you are not registering yourself, your identity will be permanently saved into their server. And your name, address, phone number, and email will also be saved on their server.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/privacy-of-website.jpg"                      alt="privacy-of-website"                ></p><hr><h2 id="Hackers-3"><a href="#Hackers-3" class="headerlink" title="Hackers"></a>Hackers</h2><p>Since this website saves your data and information for around 4 months, which makes it easy for hackers to get into their servers and extract all that data.

Instead of buying expensive music instruments, they can install dedicated plugins and get the same results without any hassle.</p><p>Of course, with so many available options, it can get a bit hectic to evaluate which VST plugins are worth installing. That’s why we’ve put together a list of 10 <strong>best free VST plugins</strong> so that you can pick the best ones to fulfill your requirements.</p><p>So, without any further ado, let’s start the list.</p><p>You might also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8 Best DAW for Chromebook to Make Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Free-VST-Plugins-3"><a href="#Best-Free-VST-Plugins-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Free VST Plugins"></a>Best Free VST Plugins</h2><h3 id="1-Native-Instruments-3"><a href="#1-Native-Instruments-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s a complete audio-mixing bundle that contains a variety of VST plugins, virtual instruments, thousands of audio effects, and several other free resources for music production.</p><p>Earlier all these elements were available individually. However, music producers can now access all these elements with a single product bundle, making the entire audio-mixing process more convenient and quick.</p><p>You can use the KOMPLETE START audio bundle with any VST, AU, and AAX plugin compatible DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Get Access to 2,000 sounds and more than 6 GB of content</li><li>Perfect for Beginners as KOMPLETE START has everything to step-up your music production game.</li><li>Compatible With Windows as well as Mac OS.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/native-instruments.JPG"                      alt="Native Instruments"                ></p><h3 id="2-Spitfire-LABS-3"><a href="#2-Spitfire-LABS-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

It would have been an injustice to exclude Spitfire Labs’ audio project from the list of <strong>best free VST plugins</strong> as it contains some of the unique audio effects one can integrate into their audio track.</p><p>What separates Spitfire Labs from other VST plugins is that every sound is composed of musicians and sampling experts in London, which means there’s no compromise on the quality whatsoever. And, since it features a wide variety of sounds, ranging from drums to actual natural sounds from the Northern Hemisphere, you’ll have no limitations on expressing your creativity.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Get a Variety of instrumental and natural sounds in one package.</li><li>Experts compose each audio effect&#x2F;sound.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/spitfireaudio.JPG"                      alt="Spitfire LABS"                ></p><h3 id="3-Sonatina-Orchestra-3"><a href="#3-Sonatina-Orchestra-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

It’s an orchestral sample library that contains pretty much all the elements you’ll need to create an orchestration virtually.</p><p>The library contains an array of audio samples, which have different amounts of stage ambiance, based on the placement of an instrument on the stage. It means you give your audio track a real orchestral vibe using different audio samples.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Different Types of audio samples including strings, brass, keys &amp; choir, etc.</li><li>Perfect for Beginners as well as slightly experienced music composers</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sonatina-symphonic-orchestra.JPG"                      alt="Sonatina Orchestra"                ></p><h3 id="4-Keyzone-Classic-3"><a href="#4-Keyzone-Classic-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

The plugin can be installed on any operating system, be it Mac or Windows, and works with the majority of DAWs.</p><p>If you want to add a piece of soft piano music in the background of your audio track, Keyzone Classic is the perfect option. Unlike the previous <strong>best free VST plugins</strong> in our list, Keyzone Classic isn’t a complete bundle, which makes it lightweight and easy-to-use.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Get a variety of presets including Yamaha Grand Piano, Steinway Grand Piano, Basic Electric Piano</li><li>Lightweight and easy-to-install.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/keyzoneclassic.JPG"                      alt="Keyzone Classic"                ></p><h3 id="5-Plogue-Sforzando-3"><a href="#5-Plogue-Sforzando-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

With Sforzando, you can create and share instruments for free, as well as commercial purposes.</p><p>Although it might not be a suitable option for beginners or even intermediate composers. <em>Why?</em> Because there is no fancy UI that’ll help you navigate through different elements. Everything needs to be done from scratch, that too, at the SFZ file level itself. In a nutshell, you must be a skilled and highly experienced composer to operate Plogue Sforzando.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Uses SFZ file format, which is royalty-free, which means you can create and distribute instruments without any restrictions.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sforzando.JPG"                      alt="Plogue Sforzando"                ></p><h3 id="6-Simple-Sound-Delay-Plugin-3"><a href="#6-Simple-Sound-Delay-Plugin-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

It can be used in any DAW to delay audio signals with extremely accurate precision. The plugin allows you to postpone time by setting a time-frame in milliseconds or using the samples.</p><p>However, being one of the standalone and <strong>free VST plugins</strong>, Sound Delay can only be used to delay audio signals. Apart from this, it doesn’t provide any functionality whatsoever. Sound Delay is an appropriate option for music composers who have already installed dozens of individual VST plugins and want a new one that’ll help them delay audio signals as well.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Delay Audio Signals in milliseconds or using samples</li><li>Delay mid &amp; side-channels separately</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sounddelay.JPG"                      alt="Simple Sound Delay Plugin"                ></p><h3 id="7-Tube-Amplifier-Plugin-3"><a href="#7-Tube-Amplifier-Plugin-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

By no means, TubeAmp is the right choice for a beginner as one must be familiar with tube-triode.</p><p>However, if you’re an experienced music composer, Tube Amplifier will fit your studio perfectly. As we mentioned earlier, it can be used to apply asymmetric tube triode overdrive, which is usually found in single-tube microphone preamp boxes. It also contains a low-pass filter that’ll help you imitate a low-quality tube-triode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Asymmetric tube triode overdrive</li><li>Two processing modes</li><li>Additional output saturation stage</li><li>Stereo and multi-channel processing</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/tubeamp.JPG"                      alt="Tube Amplifier Plugin"                ></p><h3 id="8-Ozone-Imager-V2-3"><a href="#8-Ozone-Imager-V2-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

The tool has three different vectorscope meters that instantly show the stereo width and help you widen or narrow the sounds precisely as per the project requirements.</p><p>Ozone Imager also has a dedicated “Stereoize” feature that’ll help you turn mono sounds into stereo without any reverb. This will make it easier to enhance the overall audio effects and give a professional touch to your tracks.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Stereoize the sounds with no need for doubling</li><li>Visualize the sounds using vectorscope meters to precisely adjust their width</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/ozone-imager.JPG"                      alt="Ozone Imager V2"                ></p><h3 id="9-RS-W2395c-by-Fuse-Audio-Labs-3"><a href="#9-RS-W2395c-by-Fuse-Audio-Labs-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Or simply put, normalizing any audio file with a normalizer software searches the file for a peak volume to set a defined maximum and then brings up the rest of the audio to the same maximum level.</p><p><strong>Audio normalization</strong> is a good practice to get your audio levels right for a better-balanced video, especially imperative for dialogue clips that stand out on YouTube and other platforms. However, out of many different reasons, getting the best audio results from old-fashioned AD&#x2F;DA converters or matching a group of audios on the same volume levels are still the most common.</p><p>Nevertheless, it’s not always easy to find an efficient audio normalization tool and – most importantly – to master the process. But no worries because we have you covered. So, dive in to learn some of the best tools and how you can use them to create masterfully balanced soundtracks.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Normalize Audio Online</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Normalize Audio with Wondershare Filmora’s Auto Normalization</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Method 3: Normalize Audio with Audacity</a></li></ul><h2 id="Method-1-Normalize-Audio-Online"><a href="#Method-1-Normalize-Audio-Online" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Normalize Audio Online"></a>Method 1: Normalize Audio Online</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.video2edit.com/normalize-audio" >Video2edit online video tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a one-stop solution for all your audio and video editing needs.

What dB should I normalize audio to?"></a>1. What dB should I normalize audio to?</h3><p>Well, that entirely depends on your audio use, and there is no exact number for normalizing an audio clip. However, for safety, the trick is to stay from the maximum volume level of 0 dB. For overall mix levels, most video editors recommend normalizing audio between -10 dB to -20 dB. Likewise, in the case of a dialogue clip, the recommended audio levels are -12 dB to -15 dB. Still some other suggestions are</p><ul><li>Music: -18 dB to -22 dB</li><li>Soundeffects: -10 dB to -20 dB</li></ul><h3 id="2-What-is-the-difference-between-audio-normalization-and-compression-2"><a href="#2-What-is-the-difference-between-audio-normalization-and-compression-2" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?"></a>2. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?</h3><p><strong>Audio normalization</strong> only and purely changes the volume of a sound by applying a constant amount of gain with a goal to make the loudest peak reach 0 Db. And while normalizing also matches multiple audios to the same volume, it still does not affect the sound dynamics, unlike compression.</p><p>On the flip side, audio compression chops off the audio peaks in your recording to get a fuller, louder sound without reaching the clipping limit. In compression, you are changing a proportion of the audio over time in varying amounts.</p><h3 id="3-Will-the-audio-normalization-process-affect-the-sound-quality-2"><a href="#3-Will-the-audio-normalization-process-affect-the-sound-quality-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?"></a>3. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?</h3><p>Fortunately, no. <strong>Audio normalization</strong>, when appropriately done with the help of efficient audio editors, never affects the audio quality. When normalizing an audio clip, the digital bit having the highest level below 0 dB is identified, and all the other bits of the audio are amplified to the same level. This translates to no change in the relative difference between every bit, while the noise level also does not change. So, yes, the only thing affected is the output level and not the quality of the track.</p><h4 id="Summing-up-2"><a href="#Summing-up-2" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h4><p><strong>Audio normalization</strong> is an emerging trend as a good idea to manage high-quality audio levels. This feature can indeed benefit the final steps of mastering music production. However, you need to be careful when deciding where and when to <strong>normalize audio</strong> or avoid it for better results.</p><p>So, are you ready to level up your audio game?

What dB should I normalize audio to?"></a>1. What dB should I normalize audio to?</h3><p>Well, that entirely depends on your audio use, and there is no exact number for normalizing an audio clip. However, for safety, the trick is to stay from the maximum volume level of 0 dB. For overall mix levels, most video editors recommend normalizing audio between -10 dB to -20 dB. Likewise, in the case of a dialogue clip, the recommended audio levels are -12 dB to -15 dB. Still some other suggestions are</p><ul><li>Music: -18 dB to -22 dB</li><li>Soundeffects: -10 dB to -20 dB</li></ul><h3 id="2-What-is-the-difference-between-audio-normalization-and-compression-3"><a href="#2-What-is-the-difference-between-audio-normalization-and-compression-3" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?"></a>2. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?</h3><p><strong>Audio normalization</strong> only and purely changes the volume of a sound by applying a constant amount of gain with a goal to make the loudest peak reach 0 Db. And while normalizing also matches multiple audios to the same volume, it still does not affect the sound dynamics, unlike compression.</p><p>On the flip side, audio compression chops off the audio peaks in your recording to get a fuller, louder sound without reaching the clipping limit. In compression, you are changing a proportion of the audio over time in varying amounts.</p><h3 id="3-Will-the-audio-normalization-process-affect-the-sound-quality-3"><a href="#3-Will-the-audio-normalization-process-affect-the-sound-quality-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?"></a>3. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?</h3><p>Fortunately, no. <strong>Audio normalization</strong>, when appropriately done with the help of efficient audio editors, never affects the audio quality. When normalizing an audio clip, the digital bit having the highest level below 0 dB is identified, and all the other bits of the audio are amplified to the same level. This translates to no change in the relative difference between every bit, while the noise level also does not change. So, yes, the only thing affected is the output level and not the quality of the track.</p><h4 id="Summing-up-3"><a href="#Summing-up-3" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h4><p><strong>Audio normalization</strong> is an emerging trend as a good idea to manage high-quality audio levels. This feature can indeed benefit the final steps of mastering music production. However, you need to be careful when deciding where and when to <strong>normalize audio</strong> or avoid it for better results.</p><p>So, are you ready to level up your audio game? The above-mentioned audio editing tools are top-notch normalizers that will do the work for you.
