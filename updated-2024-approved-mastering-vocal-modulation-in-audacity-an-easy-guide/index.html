How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Audacity, the audio voice changer, offers a ‘Change Pitch’ feature with which you can change the pitch of the audio without damaging its tempo. You can separately change the speed. With this feature, you can also adjust and play with the frequency and semitones.</p>
<p>The audio editor also features to estimate the starting pitch; for instance, if A3 is a quiet note, followed by a large and loud note like C4, Audacity will detect C4. In case both notes have the same volume, Audacity will detect A3. With Audacity, you also get the ‘To’ and ‘From’ controls if you plan to change the pitch manually. To learn more about changing pitch, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step 1: For changing pitch in Audacity, start by launching the software. After launching, you can either record the audio or else, from the ‘File’ section, you can also ‘Open’ any file from your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="open your audio file"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Audacity lets you change the pitch of a whole file or else for a small portion as well. Now, to change the pitch of a small portion, click and drag the mouse along the recording. Or else, click on the name of the track to select it completely.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 3: After this, head over to the top menu and click on the ‘Effect’ section. A drop-down menu list will appear, locate and select the ‘Change Pitch’ option. You can either use the sliders to adjust the pitch or else write the percentage to change.</p>

How to Change Male Voice to Female Voice with Audacity?"></a>Part 3. How to Change Male Voice to Female Voice with Audacity?</h2><p>The most fun voice transformation is from low pitch to higher pitch. In general, modifying the male voice to a female voice, as the male pitch has a negative value and changing it to a positive pitch, modifies your voice to a female voice. What else could be better to use than the amazing Audacity voice changer? Let’s share the steps that will help you change your male voice to female.</p>
<p>Step 1: First, start by opening the Audacity audio editor. Once it has launched successfully, you should import the audio file. You can record audio with Audacity. Along with this, you can also import files from your device from the ‘File’ section, followed by the ‘Open’ option.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="upload audio track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: After your audio track is visible on the timeline, you have to select the part of the file that you want to edit. You can easily select it by clicking and dragging the mouse. If not this, you can also work with the whole track; for this, simply click on the track name to select it.</p>

                      alt="select audio portion or whole"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: After you are satisfied with the selection, head to the top menu and select the ‘Effects’ options. A drop-down list appears after this, and you have to look for the ‘Change Pitch’ option and select it.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="choose change pitch effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Normally, you can adjust the pitch by taking help from the sliders, but you can also change the pitch manually by adding a percentage. The male pitch originally will have a negative value; change it and set a positive value. You can keep changing until you are satisfied.</p>

<p> A rapid succession of shots can make any music video or a feature film more entertaining to watch. The popularity of beat edits has gone through the roof in the era of social media videos, as so many YouTubers and video content creators produce videos that are perfectly synced to the music. This video editing technique can be used in a single scene or throughout an entire video, depending on the project and the effect you would like the video to make on the viewer. Read on if you would like to learn how to edit video clips to match the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Edit-and-Auto-Sync-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-for-Free"><a href="#How-to-Edit-and-Auto-Sync-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?"></a>How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?</h2><p> Before you start editing clips to the beat, you must first ensure that all of the materials you want to include in that video are imported into the project you created in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once the footage you intend to use in your video is in the Media Bin, you should head over to the <strong>New</strong> submenu in the <strong>File menu</strong>.</p>
<p> Afterward, you can add an audio file to the timeline and ensure that the sequence settings are correct. The audio file is going to serve as the core around which you are going to build the entire video, which is why it is important to select a rhythmic song that has clearly distinguishable beats.</p>
<p> Click on the <strong>Wrench icon</strong> and choose the <strong>Show Audio Waveform</strong> option from the drop-down menu, so that you can see the beats in the audio file. Make sure that the sequence you created is selected and not the audio file you added to the timeline and then position the playhead at the beginning of the song. Listening to the music to which you would like to edit your video a few times is recommended because it will enable you to better understand where the beats are located.</p>
<p> When ready start adding markers to the sequence by using the <strong>M keyboard shortcut</strong>, so that every beat of the song contains a marker. This may take a few tries because hitting the beats can be difficult for video editors that don’t have any musical talents, but with practice, you should be able to position the markers precisely where they need to be. Also, you can make the adjustments to the video you’re creating after you sync your footage with the audio so even if the markers aren’t positioned perfectly you can make corrections later.</p>
<p> Head over to the Media Bin and proceed to add <strong>In and Out points</strong>, by either clicking on their icons or using the <strong>I and O buttons</strong>, to all video clips you want to edit to the beat. By doing so you will let Adobe Premiere know which parts of the video clips you want to keep and where it should create cuts. After setting the In and Out points for all the video clips you would like to use in your project you just have to select them. The order in which your footage is selected is important as it will determine where they are going to be placed on the timeline.</p>
<p> Choose the <strong>Automate to Sequence</strong> option from the <strong>Clip menu</strong> and once the Automate to Sequence window appears on the screen you should choose the <strong>Selection Order</strong> option from the <strong>Ordering menu</strong>. Afterward, you should select the <strong>At Unnumbered Markers</strong> setting from the <strong>Placement menu</strong> and change the <strong>Method to the Overwrite Edit.</strong></p>
<p> Make sure that the <strong>Use In&#x2F;Out Range</strong> option is enabled and click on the <strong>Ignore Audio</strong> checkbox if your video clips also contain audio. Click OK to confirm the changes and Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically match your footage to the markers you added to the sequence.</p>

In case you are looking to save some time on adding markers to a sequence, you should try the Mamoworld’s <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mamoworld.com/tools/beatedit-premiere-pro" >BeatEdit extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Adobe Premiere Pro that analyses the music and adds markers automatically. Here’s how you can edit video clips to match the beat with BeatEdit.</p>
<p><strong>How to Edit Footage to the Beat in Premiere Pro with the BeatEdit Extension?</strong></p>
<p> In order to download and install the BeatEdit in Adobe Premiere Pro, you must pay a one-time $99,99 fee. After you go through the installation process, you can launch BeatEdit from the <strong>Extensions submenu</strong> that is located in the Window menu.</p>
<p> After the BeatEdit window pops up on the screen you should click on the <strong>Load Music</strong> button in order to start the beat detection process. After the audio file is analyzed blue lines are going to be displayed at each beat and you’ll be able to hear a click sound if you play the song. BeatEdit lets you adjust the volume of the audio file you analyzed and enables you to select the beats where you want to make the cuts in your footage.</p>
<p> You can choose if you want to select beats evenly or randomly, specify their frequency or select the portion of the song from which you want to select the beats. The extension also lets you add extra markers that are not located at beat and adjust their amount or minimum distance. BeatEdit generates clip and sequence markers, so make sure that the sequence markers option is selected before clicking on the <strong>Create Markers</strong> button.</p>
<p> Add the audio file you would like to use in your video to the Adobe Premiere Pro’s timeline and proceed to select the video clips in the Media Bin. Place the playhead at the beginning of the timeline and select the Automate to Sequence option from the Clip menu. You can then select the same settings you’d select if you added the markers to the sequence on your own.</p>

<p> A rapid succession of shots can make any music video or a feature film more entertaining to watch. The popularity of beat edits has gone through the roof in the era of social media videos, as so many YouTubers and video content creators produce videos that are perfectly synced to the music. This video editing technique can be used in a single scene or throughout an entire video, depending on the project and the effect you would like the video to make on the viewer. Read on if you would like to learn how to edit video clips to match the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Edit-and-Auto-Sync-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-for-Free-1"><a href="#How-to-Edit-and-Auto-Sync-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-for-Free-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?"></a>How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?</h2><p> Before you start editing clips to the beat, you must first ensure that all of the materials you want to include in that video are imported into the project you created in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once the footage you intend to use in your video is in the Media Bin, you should head over to the <strong>New</strong> submenu in the <strong>File menu</strong>.</p>
<p> Afterward, you can add an audio file to the timeline and ensure that the sequence settings are correct. The audio file is going to serve as the core around which you are going to build the entire video, which is why it is important to select a rhythmic song that has clearly distinguishable beats.</p>
<p> Click on the <strong>Wrench icon</strong> and choose the <strong>Show Audio Waveform</strong> option from the drop-down menu, so that you can see the beats in the audio file. Make sure that the sequence you created is selected and not the audio file you added to the timeline and then position the playhead at the beginning of the song. Listening to the music to which you would like to edit your video a few times is recommended because it will enable you to better understand where the beats are located.</p>
<p> When ready start adding markers to the sequence by using the <strong>M keyboard shortcut</strong>, so that every beat of the song contains a marker. This may take a few tries because hitting the beats can be difficult for video editors that don’t have any musical talents, but with practice, you should be able to position the markers precisely where they need to be. Also, you can make the adjustments to the video you’re creating after you sync your footage with the audio so even if the markers aren’t positioned perfectly you can make corrections later.</p>
<p> Head over to the Media Bin and proceed to add <strong>In and Out points</strong>, by either clicking on their icons or using the <strong>I and O buttons</strong>, to all video clips you want to edit to the beat. By doing so you will let Adobe Premiere know which parts of the video clips you want to keep and where it should create cuts. After setting the In and Out points for all the video clips you would like to use in your project you just have to select them. The order in which your footage is selected is important as it will determine where they are going to be placed on the timeline.</p>
<p> Choose the <strong>Automate to Sequence</strong> option from the <strong>Clip menu</strong> and once the Automate to Sequence window appears on the screen you should choose the <strong>Selection Order</strong> option from the <strong>Ordering menu</strong>. Afterward, you should select the <strong>At Unnumbered Markers</strong> setting from the <strong>Placement menu</strong> and change the <strong>Method to the Overwrite Edit.</strong></p>
<p> Make sure that the <strong>Use In&#x2F;Out Range</strong> option is enabled and click on the <strong>Ignore Audio</strong> checkbox if your video clips also contain audio. Click OK to confirm the changes and Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically match your footage to the markers you added to the sequence.</p>

<p><strong>How to Edit Footage to the Beat in Premiere Pro with the BeatEdit Extension?</strong></p>
<p> In order to download and install the BeatEdit in Adobe Premiere Pro, you must pay a one-time $99,99 fee. After you go through the installation process, you can launch BeatEdit from the <strong>Extensions submenu</strong> that is located in the Window menu.</p>
<p> After the BeatEdit window pops up on the screen you should click on the <strong>Load Music</strong> button in order to start the beat detection process. After the audio file is analyzed blue lines are going to be displayed at each beat and you’ll be able to hear a click sound if you play the song. BeatEdit lets you adjust the volume of the audio file you analyzed and enables you to select the beats where you want to make the cuts in your footage.</p>
<p> You can choose if you want to select beats evenly or randomly, specify their frequency or select the portion of the song from which you want to select the beats. The extension also lets you add extra markers that are not located at beat and adjust their amount or minimum distance. BeatEdit generates clip and sequence markers, so make sure that the sequence markers option is selected before clicking on the <strong>Create Markers</strong> button.</p>
<p> Add the audio file you would like to use in your video to the Adobe Premiere Pro’s timeline and proceed to select the video clips in the Media Bin.
