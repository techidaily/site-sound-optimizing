One of the features of this update was that it included built-in music and song recognition button that makes it easier for the user to recognize any song playing around them.</p>
<p>You just need to add the iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center menu and simply press that button when you hear a song that you like. You will then get all the information related to that song; title, artist’s name, and album title.</p>
<p>Here is how you add the in-built iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center:</p>
<p>Note: Make sure that you have the latest version of the iOS installed on your iPhone as this feature is not available on older versions. To check the running version, go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About, and then you will see the software version.</p>
<p>Step 1 - Open Settings&gt; Control Center, and then tap <strong>More</strong> to scroll down.</p>
<p>Step 2- Tap the “+” button that is next to “Music Recognition”, and the iPhone music recognition button is added to the Control Center</p>

                ></p>
<p>It is very easy to access and use this music recognition feature. If you have an iPhone that uses facial ID recognition to unlock, then pull down the Control Center shade by swiping down from the top right corner of the phone and tap the music recognition button.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If your iPhone has a home button, then swipe up to get into the Control Center menu and tap the music recognition button.</p>
<p>You will see the Music Recognition notification icon that shows which song is playing.</p>
<p>The iPhone will listen for around 10 to 15 seconds once you tap the button – and will attempt to identify the song in that time period.</p>
<p>This feature can recognize songs playing in your environment even when your headphones are plugged in.</p>

Following are the two best iPhone music recognition apps that you can use:</p>

<p>You can use the app for The paid service of Shazam goes by the name of Shazam Encore and it costs $2.99.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shazam-3"><a href="#2-Shazam-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Shazam"></a>2.  Shazam</h3><p>Shazam is the most popular music recognition app available out there, and its features will tell you why. To begin with, it does the basic task of any music recognition service with near 100% accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Choose-a-Music-Recognition-App-3"><a href="#How-to-Choose-a-Music-Recognition-App-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose a Music Recognition App?"></a>How to Choose a Music Recognition App?</h2><p>Version 14.2 has made it easy to recognize songs on your iDevices. But those who do not have it need a third-party app to do that job. You need to look for a good iPhone song recognition app, one that does the job to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of such apps available on the Apple App Store, and you need to sift through them to get the best one. Following are the features you should consider while choosing the most appropriate app:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, you come across unknown songs in noisy surroundings. It can be at a party or the supermarket. Your song recording can be interrupted by some loud noise like joyous shouts or announcements in both scenarios. Hence, it is vital that the music recognition app launches, listens and identifies in a few seconds before any interruption takes place.</p>
<p>Ideally, the app should recognize the song within a span of 5 to 10 seconds of launching.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tenacity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As already been said, you are more likely to encounter an unknown song or tune you like in a noisy environment. Keeping that in mind, the song identifier app must be able to distinguish between the song you want to identify and the surrounding noise accompanying it.</p>
<p>The Trial and error method is the best way to determine which app does the best job in this case. Test the apps in a noisy environment before you decide which you will ultimately use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying a song title, the artists, the album it belongs to with nearly 100% accuracy is a must for any music recognition app. Besides that basic info, it must give accurate allied information like music videos, covers and trivia regarding the singer and the song.</p>
<p>Don’t bother yourself with an app that doesn’t recognize at least 8 of 10 songs it hears.</p>

<li><strong>Should I install Shazam app on iPhone to recognize songs?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It depends on what version of iOS you are running. If the version is 14.2 and above, you don’t need to install Shazam separately as it comes integrated with your iPhone software. The in-built music recognition feature of the iPhone uses the Shazam database, and it recognizes songs and tunes the way the Shazam app does.</p>
<p>If you are running an older version, you need to install Shazam separately if you want to use it.</p>
<ol>

After understanding the best alternative of <strong>iMovie sound editin</strong> <strong>g</strong>, let’s check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.</p>
<p>The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.</p>
<p>So, here we go!</p>
<h3 id="1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear"><a href="#1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear"></a>1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear</h3><p>To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.</p>
<p>You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can’t be seen, go to the <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu and choose <strong>the</strong> <strong>Show</strong> <strong>Waveforms</strong> option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.</p>
<p>The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.</p>
<h3 id="2-Audio-Adjustments"><a href="#2-Audio-Adjustments" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Adjustments"></a>2. Audio Adjustments</h3><p>With the help of <strong>Adjust</strong> tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip’s volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.</p>
<p>The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.</p>
<h3 id="3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline"><a href="#3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="3. Edit Audio with the Timeline"></a>3. Edit Audio with the Timeline</h3><p>iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain <strong>Fade In</strong> and <strong>Fade Out</strong> tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade’s length.</p>
<p>By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.</p>
<h3 id="4-Detach-the-Audio"><a href="#4-Detach-the-Audio" class="headerlink" title="4. Detach the Audio"></a>4. Detach the Audio</h3><p>By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.</p>
<p>For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the <strong>Modify</strong> drop-down menu, and hit the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> button. You’ll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.</p>
<p>A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio’s middle portion while leaving the video intact.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding <strong>iMovie audio editing</strong>and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project’s presence.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select <strong>Modify</strong> &gt; <strong>Trim to Playhead</strong> option in the menu bar.</li>

So, here’s what you need to do!</p>
<p>Method 1. Click the <strong>Speed</strong> button above the Viewer. Next, select <strong>Custom</strong> in the Speed drop-down box and enter a percentage next to it. You can also set a different speed in that box if you prefer.</p>

Audio clips are always present below the video clips in the timeline. To edit audio clips in iMovie on your iPhones or iPads, you can follow the guide belo</p>
<h4 id="Move-an-Audio-Clip-1"><a href="#Move-an-Audio-Clip-1" class="headerlink" title="Move an Audio Clip"></a>Move an Audio Clip</h4><p>You can transfer the whole audio clip, except the background music, to another location.</p>
<ul>

<li>Drag the clip to another place and release.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Adjust-the-Audio-Clip’s-Duration-1"><a href="#Adjust-the-Audio-Clip’s-Duration-1" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration"></a>Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration</h4><p>Step 1. While the project is launched in the timeline, tap the audio clip (in blue or purple) or the background music clip you wish to adjust.</p>
<p>Step 2. Now, you can see the display of yellow trim handles. Drag them either at the end of the clip to the points where you wish the audio to start and end. If a trim handle won’t move left or right, it simply indicates there is no additional audio to work with on that clip’s end.</p>
<p>Step 3. Tap outside the audio clip and let the trim handles disappear.</p>
<h4 id="Split-an-Audio-Clip-1"><a href="#Split-an-Audio-Clip-1" class="headerlink" title="Split an Audio Clip"></a>Split an Audio Clip</h4><p>There are around two options to split audio clips in iMovie.

Ducking lowers the background music clips’ volume whenever there’s a video clip whose sound is playing simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can select which audio clips are in the foreground or the background.</p>
<p>Step 1. Select the timeline’s audio clip to display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p>

After understanding the best alternative of <strong>iMovie sound editin</strong> <strong>g</strong>, let’s check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.</p>
<p>The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.</p>
<p>So, here we go!</p>
<h3 id="1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear-2"><a href="#1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear"></a>1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear</h3><p>To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.</p>
<p>You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can’t be seen, go to the <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu and choose <strong>the</strong> <strong>Show</strong> <strong>Waveforms</strong> option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.</p>
<p>The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.</p>
<h3 id="2-Audio-Adjustments-2"><a href="#2-Audio-Adjustments-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Adjustments"></a>2. Audio Adjustments</h3><p>With the help of <strong>Adjust</strong> tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip’s volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.</p>
<p>The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.</p>
<h3 id="3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline-2"><a href="#3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Edit Audio with the Timeline"></a>3. Edit Audio with the Timeline</h3><p>iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain <strong>Fade In</strong> and <strong>Fade Out</strong> tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade’s length.</p>
<p>By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.</p>
<h3 id="4-Detach-the-Audio-2"><a href="#4-Detach-the-Audio-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Detach the Audio"></a>4. Detach the Audio</h3><p>By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.</p>
<p>For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the <strong>Modify</strong> drop-down menu, and hit the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> button. You’ll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.</p>
<p>A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio’s middle portion while leaving the video intact.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding <strong>iMovie audio editing</strong>and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project’s presence.</p>

After understanding the best alternative of <strong>iMovie sound editin</strong> <strong>g</strong>, let’s check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.</p>
<p>The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.</p>
<p>So, here we go!</p>
<h3 id="1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear-3"><a href="#1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear"></a>1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear</h3><p>To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.</p>
<p>You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can’t be seen, go to the <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu and choose <strong>the</strong> <strong>Show</strong> <strong>Waveforms</strong> option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.</p>
<p>The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.</p>
<h3 id="2-Audio-Adjustments-3"><a href="#2-Audio-Adjustments-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Adjustments"></a>2. Audio Adjustments</h3><p>With the help of <strong>Adjust</strong> tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip’s volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.</p>
<p>The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.</p>
<h3 id="3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline-3"><a href="#3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Edit Audio with the Timeline"></a>3. Edit Audio with the Timeline</h3><p>iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain <strong>Fade In</strong> and <strong>Fade Out</strong> tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade’s length.</p>
<p>By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.</p>
<h3 id="4-Detach-the-Audio-3"><a href="#4-Detach-the-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Detach the Audio"></a>4. Detach the Audio</h3><p>By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.</p>
<p>For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the <strong>Modify</strong> drop-down menu, and hit the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> button. You’ll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.</p>
<p>A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio’s middle portion while leaving the video intact.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding <strong>iMovie audio editing</strong>and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project’s presence.</p>
