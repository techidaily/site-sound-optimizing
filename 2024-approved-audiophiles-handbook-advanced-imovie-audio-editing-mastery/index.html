<p>iMovie offers a fantastic platform for video editing where you can merge multiple video clips to create something very phenomenal. Plus, it’s simply here to navigate between different scenes, edit video clips and save results directly to the digital format without making any videotape transformations.</p>
<p>It provides lots of things to beginners and professionals with its easy-to-use interface without any quality loss for your results even after adding lots of transitions, changes, and effects.</p>
<p>However, it is not accessible to master software, precisely when you’re not familiar with it, or you’re not its professional user. So today, we’d like to explore or pay attention to <strong>iMovie’s audio editing</strong> steps, tips, and tricks to help you become an iMovie master quickly.</p>
<p>What’s more, a practical yet professional iMovie alternative software is also advisable in this guide. So when the iMovie cannot fulfil your editing requirements, why don’t you hop on an iMovie alternative software?</p>
<p>Now, let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Edit-Audio-Clips-in-iMovie"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Edit-Audio-Clips-in-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Edit Audio Clips in iMovie?"></a>Part 1: How to Edit Audio Clips in iMovie?</h2><p>To learn <strong>how to edit audio clips in iMovie</strong>, you can use actions in the menu along with the quick shortcuts to make adjustments to your audio clips in iMovie on Mac. It’s a tip for your convenience!</p>
<h4 id="Trim-Audio-Clips"><a href="#Trim-Audio-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Trim Audio Clips"></a>Trim Audio Clips</h4><p>There are a couple of options to trim an audio clip in iMovie.</p>
<p><strong>#1. Trim to Playhead</strong></p>
<p>You can place the playhead in your timeline. Now, trim an audio clip to that exact spot. Next, start moving the playhead and do one from the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>Modify</strong> &gt; <strong>Trim to Playhead</strong> option in the menu bar.</li>
<li>Right-click the audio clip and select the option of <strong>Trim to Playhead</strong> in the shortcut menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>#2. Use the Clip Trimmer</strong></p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Clip Trimmer</strong> to trim an exact section of the clip.</p>
<p>Step 1. Right-click the audio clip and select <strong>Show Clip Trimmer</strong> in the shortcut menu.</p>
<p>Step 2. After the <strong>Clip Trimmer</strong> shows, select a section you wish to trim by dragging the arrows right and left while holding the white lines. The area within those lines is what will get entirely deleted.</p>
<p>Move the entire clip but keep the trim area in place if arrows turn to a film strip icon.</p>
<p>Step 3. Click <strong>Close Clip Trimmer</strong> after you finish this section.</p>
<h4 id="Shorten-or-Lengthen-Audio-Clips"><a href="#Shorten-or-Lengthen-Audio-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Shorten or Lengthen Audio Clips"></a>Shorten or Lengthen Audio Clips</h4><p>You can easily shorten or lengthen an audio clip in iMovie. Just choose the pin in the timeline and drag one of its edges. The duration of the clip change will change as you carry. And a new course will be displayed after you finish in the upper left menu.</p>
<p>You can also set the clip’s duration to an exact time. Select the clip in the timeline and hit the Clip Information (small letter “i”) tab located above the Viewer. Put the value of the time you want in seconds in the <strong>Duration</strong> box on the right.</p>
<h4 id="Change-the-Speed-of-an-Audio-Clip"><a href="#Change-the-Speed-of-an-Audio-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Change the Speed of an Audio Clip"></a>Change the Speed of an Audio Clip</h4><p>You may want to speed up or slow down an audio clip while editing music in iMovie. So, here’s what you need to do!</p>
<p>Method 1. Click the <strong>Speed</strong> button above the Viewer. Next, select <strong>Custom</strong> in the Speed drop-down box and enter a percentage next to it. You can also set a different speed in that box if you prefer.</p>
<p>Method 2. Right-click the clip and select <strong>Show Speed Editor</strong> from the shortcut menu. A slider will then display at the top of the clip that you can move to change the speed.</p>
<h4 id="Adjust-the-Volume-of-an-Audio-Clip"><a href="#Adjust-the-Volume-of-an-Audio-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the Volume of an Audio Clip"></a>Adjust the Volume of an Audio Clip</h4><p>You can set the audio clip’s volume at higher or lower, or even mute it. Just select the clip and then do one of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>Volume</strong> tab above the Viewer option and move the slider to the percentage of volume. Hit the <strong>Mute</strong> button to mute the audio clip.</li>
<li>Tap inside the clip, and when the two-sided arrow appears, drag up or down to adjust the volume.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Fade-an-Audio-Clip"><a href="#Fade-an-Audio-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Fade an Audio Clip"></a>Fade an Audio Clip</h4><p>While editing audio in iMovie, you can also fade in or out the clip. Choose a clip in the timeline and then drag the fade handle (small circle) at either the ending or the beginning of the clip to make a fade-out or a fade-in effect.</p>

After understanding the best alternative of <strong>iMovie sound editin</strong> <strong>g</strong>, let’s check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.</p>
<p>The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.</p>
<p>So, here we go!</p>
<h3 id="1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear"><a href="#1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear"></a>1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear</h3><p>To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.</p>
<p>You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can’t be seen, go to the <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu and choose <strong>the</strong> <strong>Show</strong> <strong>Waveforms</strong> option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.</p>
<p>The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.</p>
<h3 id="2-Audio-Adjustments"><a href="#2-Audio-Adjustments" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Adjustments"></a>2. Audio Adjustments</h3><p>With the help of <strong>Adjust</strong> tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip’s volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.</p>
<p>The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.</p>
<h3 id="3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline"><a href="#3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="3. Edit Audio with the Timeline"></a>3. Edit Audio with the Timeline</h3><p>iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain <strong>Fade In</strong> and <strong>Fade Out</strong> tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade’s length.</p>
<p>By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.</p>
<h3 id="4-Detach-the-Audio"><a href="#4-Detach-the-Audio" class="headerlink" title="4. Detach the Audio"></a>4. Detach the Audio</h3><p>By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.</p>
<p>For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the <strong>Modify</strong> drop-down menu, and hit the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> button. You’ll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.</p>
<p>A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio’s middle portion while leaving the video intact.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding <strong>iMovie audio editing</strong>and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project’s presence.</p>

After understanding the best alternative of <strong>iMovie sound editin</strong> <strong>g</strong>, let’s check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.</p>
<p>The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.</p>
<p>So, here we go!</p>
<h3 id="1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear-1"><a href="#1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear"></a>1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear</h3><p>To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.</p>
<p>You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can’t be seen, go to the <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu and choose <strong>the</strong> <strong>Show</strong> <strong>Waveforms</strong> option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.</p>
<p>The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.</p>
<h3 id="2-Audio-Adjustments-1"><a href="#2-Audio-Adjustments-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Adjustments"></a>2. Audio Adjustments</h3><p>With the help of <strong>Adjust</strong> tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip’s volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.</p>
<p>The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.</p>
<h3 id="3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline-1"><a href="#3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Edit Audio with the Timeline"></a>3. Edit Audio with the Timeline</h3><p>iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain <strong>Fade In</strong> and <strong>Fade Out</strong> tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade’s length.</p>
<p>By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.</p>
<h3 id="4-Detach-the-Audio-1"><a href="#4-Detach-the-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Detach the Audio"></a>4. Detach the Audio</h3><p>By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.</p>
<p>For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the <strong>Modify</strong> drop-down menu, and hit the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> button. You’ll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.</p>
<p>A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio’s middle portion while leaving the video intact.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding <strong>iMovie audio editing</strong>and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project’s presence.</p>

So, here’s what you need to do!</p>
<p>Method 1. Click the <strong>Speed</strong> button above the Viewer. Next, select <strong>Custom</strong> in the Speed drop-down box and enter a percentage next to it. You can also set a different speed in that box if you prefer.</p>

Audio clips are always present below the video clips in the timeline. To edit audio clips in iMovie on your iPhones or iPads, you can follow the guide belo</p>
<h4 id="Move-an-Audio-Clip-2"><a href="#Move-an-Audio-Clip-2" class="headerlink" title="Move an Audio Clip"></a>Move an Audio Clip</h4><p>You can transfer the whole audio clip, except the background music, to another location.</p>
<ul>

<li>Drag the clip to another place and release.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Adjust-the-Audio-Clip’s-Duration-2"><a href="#Adjust-the-Audio-Clip’s-Duration-2" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration"></a>Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration</h4><p>Step 1. While the project is launched in the timeline, tap the audio clip (in blue or purple) or the background music clip you wish to adjust.</p>
<p>Step 2. Now, you can see the display of yellow trim handles. Drag them either at the end of the clip to the points where you wish the audio to start and end. If a trim handle won’t move left or right, it simply indicates there is no additional audio to work with on that clip’s end.</p>
<p>Step 3. Tap outside the audio clip and let the trim handles disappear.</p>
<h4 id="Split-an-Audio-Clip-2"><a href="#Split-an-Audio-Clip-2" class="headerlink" title="Split an Audio Clip"></a>Split an Audio Clip</h4><p>There are around two options to split audio clips in iMovie.

<p>Step 2. Click the audio clip to display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p>
<p>Step 3. Now, click the <strong>Actions</strong> button, and select the <strong>Split</strong> tab.</p>

Audio clips are always present below the video clips in the timeline. To edit audio clips in iMovie on your iPhones or iPads, you can follow the guide belo</p>
<h4 id="Move-an-Audio-Clip-3"><a href="#Move-an-Audio-Clip-3" class="headerlink" title="Move an Audio Clip"></a>Move an Audio Clip</h4><p>You can transfer the whole audio clip, except the background music, to another location.</p>
<ul>
<li>Touch and hold the purple or blue audio clip with your project open in the timeline until it comes over the timeline bar.</li>
<li>Drag the clip to another place and release.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Adjust-the-Audio-Clip’s-Duration-3"><a href="#Adjust-the-Audio-Clip’s-Duration-3" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration"></a>Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration</h4><p>Step 1. While the project is launched in the timeline, tap the audio clip (in blue or purple) or the background music clip you wish to adjust.</p>
<p>Step 2. Now, you can see the display of yellow trim handles. Drag them either at the end of the clip to the points where you wish the audio to start and end. If a trim handle won’t move left or right, it simply indicates there is no additional audio to work with on that clip’s end.</p>
<p>Step 3. Tap outside the audio clip and let the trim handles disappear.</p>
<h4 id="Split-an-Audio-Clip-3"><a href="#Split-an-Audio-Clip-3" class="headerlink" title="Split an Audio Clip"></a>Split an Audio Clip</h4><p>There are around two options to split audio clips in iMovie. You can remove unwanted parts or adjust each section’s duration, volume, or speed while you split a clip.</p>
<p>Step 1. With your launched project in the timeline, scroll the timeline to the playhead’s position where you want to split the audio.</p>
<p>Step 2. Click the audio clip to display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p>
<p>Step 3. Now, click the <strong>Actions</strong> button, and select the <strong>Split</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Or, you can tap the clip (it becomes outlined in yellow), then swipe above the playhead as if you were placing your finger to slide over it.</p>

Ducking lowers the background music clips’ volume whenever there’s a video clip whose sound is playing simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can select which audio clips are in the foreground or the background.</p>
<p>Step 1. Select the timeline’s audio clip to display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p>
<p>Step 2. Hit the <strong>Actions</strong> tab and proceed with selecting the <strong>Foreground</strong> or <strong>Background</strong>.</p>

After understanding the best alternative of <strong>iMovie sound editin</strong> <strong>g</strong>, let’s check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.</p>
<p>The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.</p>
<p>So, here we go!</p>
<h3 id="1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear-3"><a href="#1-Use-Waveforms-to-See-What-You-Hear-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear"></a>1. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear</h3><p>To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.</p>
<p>You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can’t be seen, go to the <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu and choose <strong>the</strong> <strong>Show</strong> <strong>Waveforms</strong> option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.</p>
<p>The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.</p>
<h3 id="2-Audio-Adjustments-3"><a href="#2-Audio-Adjustments-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Adjustments"></a>2. Audio Adjustments</h3><p>With the help of <strong>Adjust</strong> tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip’s volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.</p>
<p>The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.</p>
<h3 id="3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline-3"><a href="#3-Edit-Audio-with-the-Timeline-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Edit Audio with the Timeline"></a>3. Edit Audio with the Timeline</h3><p>iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain <strong>Fade In</strong> and <strong>Fade Out</strong> tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade’s length.</p>
<p>By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.</p>
<h3 id="4-Detach-the-Audio-3"><a href="#4-Detach-the-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Detach the Audio"></a>4. Detach the Audio</h3><p>By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.</p>
<p>For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the <strong>Modify</strong> drop-down menu, and hit the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> button. You’ll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.</p>
<p>A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio’s middle portion while leaving the video intact.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding <strong>iMovie audio editing</strong>and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project’s presence.</p>

<h2 id="Best-Value-Volume-Scaling-Software-5-Top-Gratis-Options"><a href="#Best-Value-Volume-Scaling-Software-5-Top-Gratis-Options" class="headerlink" title="Best Value Volume Scaling Software: 5 Top Gratis Options"></a>Best Value Volume Scaling Software: 5 Top Gratis Options</h2><p>When you are listening to music, or to podcast, or some other type of audio files, would it make it enjoyable if the volume was so low at some point that you couldn’t understand anything? Now add another possibility to this very unpleasant imagination – what if the volume was so high at another point that your ears can’t handle it? – Of course, you would stop listening, and you would also not think high of the creator of this content. In other words, this will become the reason why this creator might lose their audiences. Well, sad story for the creator, isn’t it? And, what if YOU were the creator? A little laziness or a failure in paying attention to detail and your content goes to waste!</p>
<p>So, what is the solution? Of course, a little editing! Even if your voice doesn’t sound like it’s worth listening, you can make it happen by normalizing the volume. This actually is the process when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, which is “the norm” for the project. When this tool is applied to the volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece is affected the same way, and the relative dynamics are not changed.</p>
<p>With this tool, you have an extra guarantor that people will want to convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners, because simply, their user experience is now favored, they enjoy a good, edited content.</p>
<p>Actually, we might use audio normalizing when we need to get the maximum volume, but another reason is is when we need to match different volumes.</p>
<p>As in most cases, there is not only one type of audio normalization, so let’s explain what each of them represents: one is a so-called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; another is called loudness normalization and it adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness. RMS (Root-Mean-Square), changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.</p>
<p>With this knowledge in mind, let’s now move to the topic we are going to cover in this article: let’s discuss 5 best free MP3 volume normalizers. Knowing about them will save you time and equip you with the right ways so that when you are going to need audio normalization, you will choose one of them, bypass exhausting process of the research, and find the free, easy-to-use programs that will help you master your sounds!</p>
<p>So, we chose the following programs as 5 best free MP3 normalizers: Wondershare Filmora X, Adobe Premiere Pro, VLC Media Player, MP3 Gain and Movavi.</p>
<h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora-X"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-X" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora X"></a>Wondershare Filmora X</h2><p>Now, even though we already know how to normalize audio in VLC in the simplest, as well as in the more advanced way, it might be even better if we know some more about normalizing audios in different programs. Something worth discussing is a software called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which carries out the same task wonderfully. Although, unlike VLC Media Player, it is a real video editor, but don’t panic if you have never laid your hand on editing – it is one of the easiest to use ini the word, operating also both on Mac and Windows, and its interface is utterly understandable for beginners right away. And, actually, it is a qhile that Wondershare Filmora X introduced the feature to normalize the audio for the first time. What to say more - you might want to stop now and download the latest version of Filmora X because now we are about to learn how to normalize audio from the video there – so, tune in!</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p>

<p>When it is done installing, open the software. Now, click and drag the video of which the audio you want to normalize. Now you can select the clip you have chosen – if there are multiple, select all of them, then right-click and choose Detach Audio.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Now if you have this kind of graphic before your eyes, you can be pretty sure without even listening, that the noises are really, really different from each other, which highlights once again how useful audio normalization can be:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="noises are different from each other"
                ></p>
<p>Select these files, right-click and choose Adjust Audio. New panel will be opened on left top and there, you will see Audio Normalization – check the box there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-03.jpg"
                      alt="select files"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-04.jpg"
                      alt="choose adjust audio"
                ></p>
<p>After you have clicked on it, wait until the normalization completes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="complete normalization"
                ></p>
<p>Soon, all audio will be normalized, and you will already be able to see on the graphics that the volumes are almost on the same level and when you listen to it, you will make sure that there is no longer apparent difference between how they sound. And from there on, you can save the file you just normalized!</p>
<h2 id="Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>Adobe Premiere Pro</h2><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is the industry-leading video editing software, and it is a timeline-based. Premiere Pro always tries to make its use easier and easier, as new features are rolling out regularly to simplify steps and save time. The very same can be said about normalizing audio files, which is actually pretty easy once mastered in a very short time. That is actually why it used by beginners and professionals alike.</p>
<p>To normalize audio Adobe Premiere Pro, first, import your MP3 there. In the timeline, you will see your files in the sequence, in the sound section. Now, the best way to work on them is increase the track height – for that, you need to double-click on the empty space there, next to the little microphone icon.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="increase track height"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the track is high, and you can see more of your track. So, say that one of your MP3’s seems very loud, and another is much quieter. Speaking of the loud one, if you can see on the right that there is some red light, it is not a good sign – meaning that audio went above zero (so-called clipping), so you need to avoid it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="avoid clipping"
                ></p>
<p>(If you can not see your audio meters, just go to Window menu and choose Audio Meters).</p>
<p>So, here, our goal is to bring our audio clips around -3 – and for it, it’s possible to bring up and down the white line on the track, but it can be pretty time-consuming actually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-09.jpg"
                      alt="bring audio clips around-3"
                ></p>
<p>So a better way to do it would be next: click on the track and then right-click, find Audio Gain, and choose Normalize Max Peak to…:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on track"
                ></p>
<p>Max Peak is basically the loudest, highest peak in the audio clip. So, you can write in -3 and click OK, which will ensure the entire audio waveform will have the gain of it adjusted so that the max peak is at -3. You can proceed to the next track and carry out the exact same process on it too. Then, on Audio Meters on the right again, you will be able to see that both tracks (or more, if you have them) peak at -3. In case you have a lot of clips on the timeline, you can select them all, then go to Audio Gain and normalize all of their max peaks simultaneously, which will save you so much time and help you enormously!</p>
<h2 id="VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="VLC Media Player"></a>VLC Media Player</h2><p>VLC is a well-known media player, it is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It is worth noting that it can also play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC and can stream from the most successful websites such as Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and so on.</p>
<p>But there is another magic a simple media player can actually do - we can also normalize volume in VLC Media Player. It is a very handy feature and it works on Windows as well as on Mac. It is very simple, so follow these steps:</p>
<p>You need to have VLC Media Player installed on your device. Once you have it installed, open VLC. Go to the Tools and Preferences and there, check the single box which is next to Normalize volume in Effects. Now, set the level to the one that works best for you. Then, when you are happy with the result, click on Save.</p>
<p>What VLC does is just let adjust the general volume, leaving the specifics out of our control.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="vlc"
                ></p>
<p>If you are not so satisfied with the simple editing and want a little more to get from the editing process on VLC, you can do more with the Audio Effects menu:</p>
<p>Find Tools and in the menu, go to Preferences. The window will open, and you need to select All in Show settings – on the bottom left corner of the window. Then, navigate to Audio, and a little below, click on Filters and highlight it. You also need to check the checkbox next to the Dynamic range compressor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-12.jpg"
                      alt="get more editing on vlc"
                ></p>
<p>In the left panel, find Compressor and select it. From now, you can make the changes to the levels as you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-13.jpg"
                      alt="find and select compressor"
                ></p>
<p>Here, concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.</p>
<p>Attack time and release time can also be very helpful. You can play around with them set them to your liking, and see if it’s better sounding, because actually this will ensure that you have a fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, unexpected volume changes.</p>
<h2 id="MP3Gain"><a href="#MP3Gain" class="headerlink" title="MP3Gain"></a>MP3Gain</h2><p>MP3Gain is actually the only one in this list which is developed exactly for the task we are discussing in this article. It is an audio normalization software tool. The tool is available on multiple platforms and is free software. It analyzes the MP3 and reversibly changes its volume. The volume can be adjusted for single files or as album where all files would have the same perceived loudness. When applying the tool, there is no quality lost in the change because the program adjusts the mp3 file directly, without decoding and re-encoding.</p>
<p>So, to use this software, go and download MP3Gain. Install and open it when it is ready. You will see that your program is absolutely empty and it has a lot of space inside, waiting for you to upload some file(s)…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp3gain"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can either choose adding files manually, with you choosing each of them, but let’s say you have an album (which would be more comfortable, needless to say) in which you want to change the volume of all MP3’s. So, in this case, you can choose Add Folder, and when the window opens, choose the folder full of your MP3’s – all your files will be added in the program.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose to add files"
                ></p>
<p>Now, find the Target “Normal” Volume above the files, and fill in the gap, if you will, or just use default dB. Then, click Album Analysis, and the process will start.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="find and target normal"
                ></p>
<p>The software will show you the volume of each of the file, and then you will need to just click on Track Gain.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on track gain"
                ></p>
<p>Now, wait for the process to be completed, and then you will see that the volumes changed for each of your files – so, it’s done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h2 id="Movavi"><a href="#Movavi" class="headerlink" title="Movavi"></a>Movavi</h2><p>Powerful multimedia software for creating and editing videos – this is Movavi. It packs lots of video and audio editing power into a simple interface. On their official web-site, the program is described as: “An all-in-one video maker: an editor, converter, screen recorder, and more. Perfect for remote work and distance learning.” So, you can go and download the program, and learn audio normalization there very easily!</p>
<p>Install and open the program and then proceed directly to Adding Files. After having chosen your file, you drag and drop it in the timeline sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="install and open program"
                ></p>
<p>If the audio is uneven, now double-click on the audio track, which will open the Clip Properties window. You will see the Normalize box, which you need to check. Doing this will even out the sound level for the whole track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="double click on audio track"
                ></p>
<p>To save the result, click Export, choose the format, folder and name for your file, and then click Start, so your file can be exported.</p>
<p>So, it’s done – now you know a whole lot more about audio normalization, its types, why and when should we use it, and which are the 5 best free MP3 normalizers, along with the detailed guidelines on how to work with those tools to have your desired results. Let’s hope that you will be able to choose from Wondershare Filmora X, Adobe Premiere Pro, VLC Media Player, MP3 Gain and Movavi, and make your user experience so wonderful, and shareable!</p>

<p>Now if you have this kind of graphic before your eyes, you can be pretty sure without even listening, that the noises are really, really different from each other, which highlights once again how useful audio normalization can be:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="noises are different from each other"
                ></p>
<p>Select these files, right-click and choose Adjust Audio. New panel will be opened on left top and there, you will see Audio Normalization – check the box there.</p>

                      alt="choose adjust audio"
                ></p>
<p>After you have clicked on it, wait until the normalization completes.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Soon, all audio will be normalized, and you will already be able to see on the graphics that the volumes are almost on the same level and when you listen to it, you will make sure that there is no longer apparent difference between how they sound. And from there on, you can save the file you just normalized!</p>

<p>Here, concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.</p>
<p>Attack time and release time can also be very helpful. You can play around with them set them to your liking, and see if it’s better sounding, because actually this will ensure that you have a fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, unexpected volume changes.</p>
<h2 id="MP3Gain-1"><a href="#MP3Gain-1" class="headerlink" title="MP3Gain"></a>MP3Gain</h2><p>MP3Gain is actually the only one in this list which is developed exactly for the task we are discussing in this article. It is an audio normalization software tool. The tool is available on multiple platforms and is free software. It analyzes the MP3 and reversibly changes its volume. The volume can be adjusted for single files or as album where all files would have the same perceived loudness. When applying the tool, there is no quality lost in the change because the program adjusts the mp3 file directly, without decoding and re-encoding.</p>
<p>So, to use this software, go and download MP3Gain. Install and open it when it is ready. You will see that your program is absolutely empty and it has a lot of space inside, waiting for you to upload some file(s)…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-14.jpg"
                      alt="mp3gain"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can either choose adding files manually, with you choosing each of them, but let’s say you have an album (which would be more comfortable, needless to say) in which you want to change the volume of all MP3’s. So, in this case, you can choose Add Folder, and when the window opens, choose the folder full of your MP3’s – all your files will be added in the program.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-15.jpg"
                      alt="choose to add files"
                ></p>
<p>Now, find the Target “Normal” Volume above the files, and fill in the gap, if you will, or just use default dB. Then, click Album Analysis, and the process will start.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-16.jpg"
                      alt="find and target normal"
                ></p>
<p>The software will show you the volume of each of the file, and then you will need to just click on Track Gain.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-17.jpg"
                      alt="click on track gain"
                ></p>
<p>Now, wait for the process to be completed, and then you will see that the volumes changed for each of your files – so, it’s done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="volumes changed for each files"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Movavi-1"><a href="#Movavi-1" class="headerlink" title="Movavi"></a>Movavi</h2><p>Powerful multimedia software for creating and editing videos – this is Movavi. It packs lots of video and audio editing power into a simple interface. On their official web-site, the program is described as: “An all-in-one video maker: an editor, converter, screen recorder, and more. Perfect for remote work and distance learning.” So, you can go and download the program, and learn audio normalization there very easily!</p>
<p>Install and open the program and then proceed directly to Adding Files. After having chosen your file, you drag and drop it in the timeline sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-19.jpg"
                      alt="install and open program"
                ></p>
<p>If the audio is uneven, now double-click on the audio track, which will open the Clip Properties window. You will see the Normalize box, which you need to check. Doing this will even out the sound level for the whole track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/free-mp3-normalizer-20.jpg"
                      alt="double click on audio track"
                ></p>
<p>To save the result, click Export, choose the format, folder and name for your file, and then click Start, so your file can be exported.</p>
<p>So, it’s done – now you know a whole lot more about audio normalization, its types, why and when should we use it, and which are the 5 best free MP3 normalizers, along with the detailed guidelines on how to work with those tools to have your desired results. Let’s hope that you will be able to choose from Wondershare Filmora X, Adobe Premiere Pro, VLC Media Player, MP3 Gain and Movavi, and make your user experience so wonderful, and shareable!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-are-podcast-directories"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-podcast-directories" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What are podcast directories?"></a>Part 1. What are podcast directories?</h2><p>A podcast directory is a listening app. It’s the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024"><a href="#Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024"></a>Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024</h2><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/" >research conducted by EdisonResearch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories. So this list will help us locate the best podcasting directories. And it can multiply your audience size and quickly reach a more extensive user base.</p>
<p>According to Edison Research, the top 15 Podcast Networks are:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="edison podcast metrics"
                ></p>
<p>You must retain that Edison’s research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.</p>
<p>Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it’s all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.</p>
<h3 id="1-YouTube"><a href="#1-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.</p>

                      alt="podcast directory youtube"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create video-based podcasts seamlessly. You can simply convert the video podcasts into an audio format using Filmora itself and then reupload the same Podcast to even audio-based podcast directories.</p>

<p>Tools like Fimora also allow you to directly publish the created Podcast on YouTube (so you do not have to worry about video requirements mandatory for YouTube).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of YouTube on G2</strong>: “YouTube is one of those sites that you can’t live without for a business. Everyone knows what YouTube is, and users (globally) use the platform daily.”</li>
<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 2.5 billion active users.</li>
<li><strong>Supported OS</strong>: All major OS and web browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Spotify"><a href="#2-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="2. Spotify"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.</p>
<p>Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.</p>

                      alt="podcast directory spotify"
                ></p>
<p>Spotify’s personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily&#x2F; Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Spotify on G2</strong>: “I can find any song, artist, album, and even podcasts at any time and no commercials.”</li>

<h3 id="3-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#3-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple Podcasts"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.apple.com/" >Apple Podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Apple Podcast is another top directory for a podcast that creators cannot ignore. Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="podcast directory apple podcast"
                ></p>
<p>The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.</p>
<p>In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Apple Podcast</strong>: “Apple once again nails with simplicity, millions of shows of my interest, and freemium service.”</li>
<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 28.5 million active users.</li>

Google Podcasts"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasts.google.com/" >Google Podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Google Podcasts has over 100 million downloads on Play Store alone and is also available on the web, App Store, Blackberry, and ChromeOS users. A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="podcast directory google podcasts"
                ></p>
<p>Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Google Podcast</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Google Podcast includes everything that a podcast listener wants. It’s simple, free, and includes valuable options like Sleep Timer, Playback speed, and more.”</p>

Pandora"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pandora.com/" >Pandora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Pandora has over 64 million monthly active users, with a listener spending up to 24 hours&#x2F;monthly on the platform. It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you’re creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>

Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.</p>
<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

<p>It is important to note that both Amazon Music and Audible offer podcasts for entirely free to users, so a more extensive user base prefers these platforms over paid platforms.</p>

<p>“I’ve been using this app for years now. It’s been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I’m not a super picky consumer, especially when I don’t pay for the app!</p>
<p>But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It’s annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer.”</p>

</ul>
<p>**”**Been using this for years. It does everything I could ever want when listening&#x2F; referencing&#x2F; re-listening to my favorite podcasts and a lot more.</p>
<p>I’ve suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something “exclusive”), but I couldn’t stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.</p>
<p>Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you’re coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app.”</p>

<p>“Glad I waited a while to find a podcast website provider. Starting from scratch in WordPress seemed too much hassle. Luckily the site came along while I was dithering about what to do.</p>
<p>The RadioPublic team onboarded the other 5 billion podcasts as one of the first examples, and I’m delighted to have chosen this option. Already, my pod site feels “complete” to look at, and more features are coming soon that will help with marketing, understanding listeners, and building a podcast brand.”</p>

<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>

<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>

<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

<p>“I’ve been using this app for years now. It’s been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I’m not a super picky consumer, especially when I don’t pay for the app!</p>
<p>But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It’s annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer.”</p>
