<p>This is just one feature of REAPER that sounds very interesting. In this section, we will talk about more of its features.</p>
<h3 id="1-Record-and-Edit"><a href="#1-Record-and-Edit" class="headerlink" title="1. Record and Edit"></a>1. Record and Edit</h3><p>You can easily record the audio and (MIDI) Musical Instrumental Digital Interface with REAPER recording software. It lets you edit and customize everything.

It has great automated capabilities for instrument and effect parameters. It doesn’t matter if you are working because you can still bounce or freeze tracks while working.</p>
<p>The mixer is very flexible. With REAPERs mixer, you just have to drag and drop your recordings so that you can create tracks, and also, you can customize the arrangements by moving the portions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Interface"><a href="#3-Interface" class="headerlink" title="3. Interface"></a>3. Interface</h3><p>While looking at the interface, you might question yourself about how to use its interface.

Is Google Play the same as Google Podcast?"></a>1. Is Google Play the same as Google Podcast?</h3><p>Earlier, Google featured podcasts on the Google Play platform (hence the name, Google Play Podcast). However, today Google Play does not feature any podcasts. So, you will have to choose Google Podcast</p>
<h3 id="2-Where-did-Google-Music-Podcasts-go"><a href="#2-Where-did-Google-Music-Podcasts-go" class="headerlink" title="2. Where did Google Music Podcasts go?"></a>2. Where did Google Music Podcasts go?</h3><p>Google shut down Google Music on February 24, 2021. However, it allowed users to move their podcasts and music files from Google Music to YouTube before that date. So, there’s a good chance you can find the earlier podcasts available on Google Music on YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="3-Is-Google-Podcasts-Ad-free"><a href="#3-Is-Google-Podcasts-Ad-free" class="headerlink" title="3. Is Google Podcasts Ad-free?"></a>3. Is Google Podcasts Ad-free?</h3><p>Yes. Google Podcast app is entirely ad-free, and there is no subscription either. So you might see in-episode promotions that individual creators present, but there are no ads in the Google Podcast app.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Hopefully, you now know the Google Podcast app and what you will find on the Google Podcast platform. As promised, we have also shown you how to use the Google Podcast app. Retain that you can use the Google Podcast app on all primary OS, including Apple and Android devices. The podcast recommendations in this guide are written to inform users about the great shows that resonate with them.</p>
<p>Another significant aspect of this guide on the Google Podcast app is creating your podcast and submitting it to the platform. Google Podcast, a directory, requires you to create your own podcast and submit the podcasts via RSS feeds. So, even if you want to make your podcast, you can use tools like Filmora and then publish it on Google Podcast to share it with the world.</p>
<p>Part 1. What is Google Podcast App?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-1.jpg"
                      alt="google podcast interface"
                ></p>
<p>Google Podcast (formerly Google Play Podcast) is Google’s proprietary podcast-listening app. It comes pre-installed on some Android smartphones and all Pixel editions. Even Apple users can install Google Podcasts via the App Store. It’s free and lets you discover, stream, and download podcasts.</p>
<p>Google Podcast has already hit 100 million downloads, an indication of its rising popularity both among content creators and users. Users prefer it for its navigable, search-aligned, minimalist interface. And prominent podcast creators are focusing on the app to make their episodes accessible to millions of Android users.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Google-Podcasts-Features-1"><a href="#Part-2-Google-Podcasts-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Google Podcasts Features"></a>Part 2: Google Podcasts Features</h2><p>Compatible with Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Blackberry, and ChromeOS, Google Podcast is relatively a novice compared to dedicated podcast services. Still, Google Podcast seamlessly incorporates nearly every feature one needs to listen to podcasts.</p>
<p>Search and Personalized Recommendations</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-2.jpg"
                      alt="google podcast search"
                ></p>
<p>The most significant feature of Google Podcast is its algorithm-based recommendations that connect users with shows that suit their listening habits. As a new user, you might want to explore new topics and taste new concepts, and that’s where Google Podcast will impress you. But even more than that, it will automatically recommend suitable podcasts depending on your interest and previous engagements with the platform.</p>
<p>Google Podcast app covers a plethora of podcasts, so you do not have to switch to other platforms to discover something new or topics you love.</p>
<p>Free and Ad-free Experience</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-3.jpg"
                      alt="google podcast ad free"
                ></p>
<p>Google Podcast is completely free in a world where podcast platforms demand high charges for an ad-free and high-quality experience. All you need is a Google account to register and listen to anything available on the platform. In addition, podcast creators have to qualify to Google’s standards before submitting the podcast on the forum, ensuring you will listen to the podcast in high quality.</p>
<p>Clean UI</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-4.jpg"
                      alt="google podcast interface"
                ></p>
<p>Whether you’ve used a podcast platform before or not, the Google Podcast platform will seem familiar. Once you sign up, the interface will welcome you with podcasts covering all genres arranged neatly in a grid view for convenience.</p>
<p>In line with simplicity, the Settings option in the Google Platform app is as basic as basic gets. Plus, it allows you to conveniently organize your subscriptions and downloads via the Library tab.</p>
<p>One more thing: although Google Podcast is primarily designed for Android users, its counterparts on other OS, like Apple, Web, and macOS, remain simple and easy to use.</p>
<p>Auto-downloads, Sleep Timer, and Seamless Switch Between Devices</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="google podcast downloads"
                ></p>
<p>Google Podcast automatically downloads the podcasts you love and removes them after you’ve listened to the particular episodes.</p>
<p>Another significant characteristic of the Google Podcast platform is its intuitiveness. For instance, many podcast platforms do not automatically switch to the next episode, but you do not have to worry about such aspects with Google Podcast. You can also put a sleep timer.</p>
<p>Given that it’s available on all primary OS, you can seamlessly switch from one device to another. Not to forget, you can search for the podcasts using Google search or your Voice Assitant.</p>

<p> Audio recordings captured with a Smartphone or any other type of sound recording device are often split into a number of separate MP3 files, that are difficult to navigate through. Fortunately, you don’t need professional audio editing software to arrange and merge multiple audio recordings into a single MP3 file, since the Internet offers a much simpler solution. In case you were looking for a quick way to mix together several MP3 files, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge MP3 and other types of audio files for free.</p>
<h2 id="Top-Free-Online-MP3-Joiners-to-Merge-MP3-Files"><a href="#Top-Free-Online-MP3-Joiners-to-Merge-MP3-Files" class="headerlink" title="Top Free Online MP3 Joiners to Merge MP3 Files"></a>Top Free Online MP3 Joiners to Merge MP3 Files</h2><p> Besides the supported audio file formats, you must consider the upload methods, the number of files a platform lets you merge or file size limitations during the process of selecting an online MP3 Joiner. So here are some of the best online MP3 joiners you can find on the World Wide Web.</p>
<h4 id="1-Audio-Joiner"><a href="#1-Audio-Joiner" class="headerlink" title="1.

Audio Joiner enables you to merge as many audio tracks as you want, and it supports more than 300 audio file formats. In addition, you can choose which parts of the files you want to include in the final mix, apply the crossfade effect that makes the transitions between two audio clips smoother or select the output format of the audio file you’re creating. When done, you simply have to click on the Join button and decide if you want to save the new audio file to your computer, Dropbox or Google Drive.</p>
<h4 id="2-MergeAudio"><a href="#2-MergeAudio" class="headerlink" title="2. MergeAudio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergeaudio.online/merge-mp3" >MergeAudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> This platform supports nearly all popular audio file formats, which means that you can use it to combine and create audio files in virtually any format you want. The MergeAudio platform doesn’t limit the number of files you can upload to it and the process of combining these files is remarkably simple. After you upload the audio files stored on your computer or online, you just have to select the output format, enable the Crossfade option and insert the name of the audio file you’re creating. Hit the Merge button to complete the process, but keep in mind that the amount of time the MergeAudio platform is going to need to create a new audio file depends on the number of files you want to merge. Click on the Play button to listen to the new audio file the platform has produced before opting for one of the available download options.</p>
<h4 id="3-Online-File-Merger"><a href="#3-Online-File-Merger" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, the platform only supports the MP3 file format, and you can’t use it merge audio files that are saved in WAV, OGG or any other formats. The process of merging MP3 files is rather simple since you just have to arrange them, select the preferred Audio Quality, Audio Sampling Rate, and Audio Channels before clicking on the Merge button. Once the files are pieced together, you should click on the Download button to save the new MP3 file to your computer. However, you won’t be able to save your creations to online storage services like Dropbox or OneDrive.</p>
<h4 id="4-Bear-File-Converter"><a href="#4-Bear-File-Converter" class="headerlink" title="4.

Just upload the files you’d like to merge by either pasting their URL to the URL box or by uploading them from your computer. The platform only lets you import MP3 files that don’t exceed the 50MB size limit, so once you’ve uploaded all the files you’d like to merge you should proceed to arrange them. Optionally, you can adjust the Audio Quality, Audio Sampling Rate, and Audio Channel settings before clicking on the Merge button.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each of the online MP3 joiners we covered in this article is easy to use, so you don’t really have to be a sound editing professional in order to merge your MP3 files with them. However, the options they offer are slightly different so you should choose the MP3 merger that best fits your needs. Which online audio editing tool are you using to merge multiple MP3 files?

<p> Audio recordings captured with a Smartphone or any other type of sound recording device are often split into a number of separate MP3 files, that are difficult to navigate through. Fortunately, you don’t need professional audio editing software to arrange and merge multiple audio recordings into a single MP3 file, since the Internet offers a much simpler solution. In case you were looking for a quick way to mix together several MP3 files, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge MP3 and other types of audio files for free.</p>
<h2 id="Top-Free-Online-MP3-Joiners-to-Merge-MP3-Files-3"><a href="#Top-Free-Online-MP3-Joiners-to-Merge-MP3-Files-3" class="headerlink" title="Top Free Online MP3 Joiners to Merge MP3 Files"></a>Top Free Online MP3 Joiners to Merge MP3 Files</h2><p> Besides the supported audio file formats, you must consider the upload methods, the number of files a platform lets you merge or file size limitations during the process of selecting an online MP3 Joiner. So here are some of the best online MP3 joiners you can find on the World Wide Web.</p>
<h4 id="1-Audio-Joiner-3"><a href="#1-Audio-Joiner-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Audio Joiner"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio-joiner.com/" >Audio Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> This audio editing tool is a part of the collection of video and sound editing tools offered by the 123Apps platform. Audio Joiner enables you to merge as many audio tracks as you want, and it supports more than 300 audio file formats. In addition, you can choose which parts of the files you want to include in the final mix, apply the crossfade effect that makes the transitions between two audio clips smoother or select the output format of the audio file you’re creating. When done, you simply have to click on the Join button and decide if you want to save the new audio file to your computer, Dropbox or Google Drive.</p>
<h4 id="2-MergeAudio-3"><a href="#2-MergeAudio-3" class="headerlink" title="2. MergeAudio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mergeaudio.online/merge-mp3" >MergeAudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> This platform supports nearly all popular audio file formats, which means that you can use it to combine and create audio files in virtually any format you want. The MergeAudio platform doesn’t limit the number of files you can upload to it and the process of combining these files is remarkably simple. After you upload the audio files stored on your computer or online, you just have to select the output format, enable the Crossfade option and insert the name of the audio file you’re creating. Hit the Merge button to complete the process, but keep in mind that the amount of time the MergeAudio platform is going to need to create a new audio file depends on the number of files you want to merge. Click on the Play button to listen to the new audio file the platform has produced before opting for one of the available download options.</p>
<h4 id="3-Online-File-Merger-3"><a href="#3-Online-File-Merger-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Online File Merger"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filesmerge.com/merge-mp3-files" >Online File Merger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> Online File Merger lets you import files via URL or directly from your computer, but the platform doesn’t allow you to upload MP3 files that are larger than 50MB. In addition, the platform only supports the MP3 file format, and you can’t use it merge audio files that are saved in WAV, OGG or any other formats. The process of merging MP3 files is rather simple since you just have to arrange them, select the preferred Audio Quality, Audio Sampling Rate, and Audio Channels before clicking on the Merge button. Once the files are pieced together, you should click on the Download button to save the new MP3 file to your computer. However, you won’t be able to save your creations to online storage services like Dropbox or OneDrive.</p>
<h4 id="4-Bear-File-Converter-3"><a href="#4-Bear-File-Converter-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Bear File Converter"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ofoct.com/merge-mp3-files" >Bear File Converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> Bear File Converter enables to merge multiple MP3 files effortlessly. Just upload the files you’d like to merge by either pasting their URL to the URL box or by uploading them from your computer. The platform only lets you import MP3 files that don’t exceed the 50MB size limit, so once you’ve uploaded all the files you’d like to merge you should proceed to arrange them. Optionally, you can adjust the Audio Quality, Audio Sampling Rate, and Audio Channel settings before clicking on the Merge button. You can save all the audio files you generate to your computer, but bear in mind that the MP3 is the only output file format the Bear File Converter supports.</p>
<h4 id="5-AConvert-3"><a href="#5-AConvert-3" class="headerlink" title="5. AConvert"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/audio/merge/" >AConvert <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> The support for a wide range of audio file formats as well as a plethora of import methods makes AConvert platform one of the best audio file joiners today. However, the maximum size of the audio file you upload can’t be larger than 200MB, and you must upload the files in the same order in which you want them to appear in the output file because the platform doesn’t allow you to rearrange your audio files after you upload them. Each file you would like to merge must have the same bitrate and format and you must click on the Submit button each time you add a new MP3 file. AConvert platform lets you save your merged MP3 files to Dropbox, Google Drive, and you can also use the QR code if you want to save the new audio file to your phone.</p>
<h4 id="6-Inettools-3"><a href="#6-Inettools-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Inettools"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://inettools.net/merge/merge-mp3-online" >Inettools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> This is a simple but powerful MP3 joiner that enables you to merge audio files in just a few easy steps. Import the files you’d like to merge to the platform from your computer and wait for them to be uploaded. Hit the Make button after the upload is completed and wait for the Results box to appear on the screen. Click on the link in the Results box if you want to listen to a new audio file you’ve created before downloading it to a hard drive on your computer. Even though merging multiple MP3 files with this platform is a straightforward process, you won’t be able to control the quality of the audio file you’re producing.</p>
<h4 id="7-MP3Cutter-3"><a href="#7-MP3Cutter-3" class="headerlink" title="7. MP3Cutter"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mp3cutter.com/audio-joiner" >MP3Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> This platform is designed to help its users cut, convert and merge all types of audio files. The Audio Joiner tool lets you import audio files from online sources or from a computer so you can choose the method that is the most convenient for you. Once you’ve uploaded all the files you’d like to merge you can simply drag them in order to rearrange them, and then you can proceed to select the output format, apply the crossfade effect or rename the new audio file. Click on the Merge button to complete the process and then save the freshly created file to your computer. The only downside is that MP3Cutter doesn’t allow you to store the audio files you merged on Dropbox and other cloud storage services.</p>
<h4 id="8-Online-MP3-Cutter-3"><a href="#8-Online-MP3-Cutter-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Online MP3 Cutter"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bearaudiotool.com/" >Online MP3 Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> Turning your favorite songs into ringtones or merging several audio files into a single MP3 file are just a few options presented by the Online MP3 Cutter tool. You can upload audio files directly from your computer, import them from YouTube or use their URL to add them to the Online MP3 Cutter. The platform also lets you record new audio files or copy, cut and crop the existing audio files. The fade in and fade out effects are also available so that you can gradually introduce a new song, while the Mute option helps you turn parts of the audio file you don’t want to include in the new audio file silent. Despite the fact that Online MP3 Cutter enables you to merge multiple audio files quickly you’re going to need at least a basic level of audio editing skills in order to use this tool efficiently.</p>
<h4 id="9-MP3Merge-3"><a href="#9-MP3Merge-3" class="headerlink" title="9. MP3Merge"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://freeonlineeditor.com/mp3merge.php" >MP3Merge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> All you have to do to start merging your MP3 files is drag and drop them to a specified area of the screen. Each file you add to this tool will be displayed in the order in which you uploaded them, which is why it is important to import MP3 files in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output file. This online audio editing tool lets you specify the start and end times of each audio file you import so that you can merge only a selected portion of each audio file. Click on the Merge Now button when ready and specify the location on your hard drive where you want the new audio file to be saved</p>
<h4 id="10-AudioTrimmer-3"><a href="#10-AudioTrimmer-3" class="headerlink" title="10. AudioTrimmer"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audiotrimmer.com/" >AudioTrimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> This online audio editing tool enables you to remove unwanted parts of your MP3 files in just a few seconds.
