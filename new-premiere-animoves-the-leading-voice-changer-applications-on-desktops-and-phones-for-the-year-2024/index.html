In the case of TV series or dramas, even professional actors often need a bit of pitch adjustment to voices. Pitch shifting is not only made easy but accessible to all as well in Premiere Pro. Below all the key steps are highlighted, which provide you with the precise process of making anime voice in PR.</p>

<p>Firstly, the audio recording needs to be uploaded to Adobe Premiere Pro. We can also directly record the audio in the Premiere Pro timeline.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will choose the effect we wish to apply. In this case, the “Pitch Shifter” effect is applied. Tap on the effects list, choose “pitch shifter,” and then drag down to the audio file.</p>
<p>Next, it’s time to adjust the pitch as per the need. We can shift the pitch higher for a sharp female voice or down for heavier vocals. If you now have achieved the desired results, you know how to use this anime girl voice changer.</p>
<p>Besides the Pitch Shifter feature in Premiere Pro, you can also use the equalizer to adjust the voice too. With an equalizer, you can give nasal effects to your audio. This effect is usually a popular trend with anime voice changers. To give nasal effects, you have to load the EQ first. Next, you need to cut or boost the frequencies as per your need. The limit provided is usually 1k to 1.2k Hz.</p>
<p>These are the main effects one gets to choose from when using Adobe Premiere.</p>

For example, you might have a YouTube channel, and you record your audio from a Microphone, your video from a webcam camera, and your screen from your computer. The audio directly from the camera could be a little faint, resulting from the recording being farther from where you are. While the audio from the microphone would give you a high-quality audio.</p>

<p>First, detach your audio file from your screen recording as the tool works with an audio file and a video file. Right-click on the audio file and click on detach audio to separate the audio file from the screen recording.</p>

<p>Return the audio file and the screen recording to the normal position, which gives you three layers on the timeline.</p>

<p>Next, select your audio and your video by making sure both footages are related to each other and then right-click and then tap the audio synchronization. This will sync the audio and the video together, and the echo will seize because the footage will perfectly match the audio.</p>

You can simply get the media from the folders and this allows you to sync a max of 16 audio files to single video.</p>
<ul>
<li>To proceed, press <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Command</strong>&gt; key on Windows and Mac respectively. Now, pick out the two files that you want to merge. You will now get the Merge Clips menu having a list of options. Choose Audio option and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>

<li>Premiere Pro will now examine your video’s audio with the help of External audio and find out the similarities. In a couple of minutes, you will receive a new file with the name given to it in the Merge Clips menu.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Another is the manual way to sync audio to your videos. In order to work with this uncomplicated way of synchronization, get your video clip and the audio file into the timeline. Make sure to stack up the two files loosely (do not group them).</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, you may have either used a professional slate&#x2F;clapper or simply done a single clap with your hands to give a clue to start performing. All you need to do is to zoom the video file in the timeline. Look for the spike in waveforms that shows the slate. Where you notice the spike, slide the audio file and make the markers lined up.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Start playing the clip to see if it works perfectly. Just in case, if a little tweaking is still required, click the audio file and hold down the Shift key while tapping left or right arrow key to adjust the audio file as per requirement.</li>
</ul>

It is a plug-in and comes for $200 from Red Giant. When you have the projects like documentaries which include numerous camera angles, PluralEyes easily handles such stuff and make audio and video synchronization easy for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>For this, run PluralEyes and hit on <strong>Add Media</strong> to import the clip. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file directly to Premiere Pro. Now, click on <strong>Synchronize</strong> and let the program do the job.</li>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice the synced clips in green while the files that are not synchronized will show up in red as errors. In case there are files with the red error, you need to get to the Sync drop-down menu and click <strong>Try Really Hard</strong>.</li>
<li>When the entire files are synced, hit on <strong>Export Timeline</strong> and you can then drag the exported project into Premiere Pro.</li>

You must have always wanted to keep a high-quality audio file, correct? More than desire, it is a vital thing to have. Hence, to record your audio appropriately, you must have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >quality microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-digital-voice-recorders/" >audio recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that should stand out from others. This dual combination is significant in capturing the sound in an excellent quality and they indeed provide better output than an on-camera microphone.</p>
<p>The audio recorders with a little more price employ XLR cables. On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1&#x2F;8” jacks.</p>
<p>You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.</p>

<p>Return the audio file and the screen recording to the normal position, which gives you three layers on the timeline.</p>

<p>Next, select your audio and your video by making sure both footages are related to each other and then right-click and then tap the audio synchronization. This will sync the audio and the video together, and the echo will seize because the footage will perfectly match the audio.</p>

You can simply get the media from the folders and this allows you to sync a max of 16 audio files to single video.</p>
<ul>
<li>To proceed, press <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Command</strong>&gt; key on Windows and Mac respectively. Now, pick out the two files that you want to merge. You will now get the Merge Clips menu having a list of options. Choose Audio option and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Premiere Pro will now examine your video’s audio with the help of External audio and find out the similarities. In a couple of minutes, you will receive a new file with the name given to it in the Merge Clips menu.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-Manually-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-Manually-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Another is the manual way to sync audio to your videos. In order to work with this uncomplicated way of synchronization, get your video clip and the audio file into the timeline. Make sure to stack up the two files loosely (do not group them).</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import files"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, you may have either used a professional slate&#x2F;clapper or simply done a single clap with your hands to give a clue to start performing. All you need to do is to zoom the video file in the timeline. Look for the spike in waveforms that shows the slate. Where you notice the spike, slide the audio file and make the markers lined up.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge audio manually"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Start playing the clip to see if it works perfectly. Just in case, if a little tweaking is still required, click the audio file and hold down the Shift key while tapping left or right arrow key to adjust the audio file as per requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

It is a plug-in and comes for $200 from Red Giant. When you have the projects like documentaries which include numerous camera angles, PluralEyes easily handles such stuff and make audio and video synchronization easy for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>For this, run PluralEyes and hit on <strong>Add Media</strong> to import the clip. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file directly to Premiere Pro. Now, click on <strong>Synchronize</strong> and let the program do the job.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PluralEyes sync audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice the synced clips in green while the files that are not synchronized will show up in red as errors. In case there are files with the red error, you need to get to the Sync drop-down menu and click <strong>Try Really Hard</strong>.</li>
<li>When the entire files are synced, hit on <strong>Export Timeline</strong> and you can then drag the exported project into Premiere Pro.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Bonus-Tips-How-to-Record-Audio-Properly-3"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-How-to-Record-Audio-Properly-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly"></a>Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly</h2><p>Nothing is worse than a bad quality audio file. You must have always wanted to keep a high-quality audio file, correct? More than desire, it is a vital thing to have. Hence, to record your audio appropriately, you must have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >quality microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-digital-voice-recorders/" >audio recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that should stand out from others. This dual combination is significant in capturing the sound in an excellent quality and they indeed provide better output than an on-camera microphone.</p>
<p>The audio recorders with a little more price employ XLR cables. On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1&#x2F;8” jacks.</p>
<p>You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.</p>
